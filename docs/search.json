    "section": "1.2 What is a Virus?",
    "text": "1.2 What is a Virus?\nViruses were originally said to be tiny objects that can pass through filters (unlike bacteria), but nonetheless, a virus is a tiny particle that has genetic material, a protein shell, and sometimes, a fatty covering.\nViruses can be differerently complex in terms of their genetic or molecular makeup, but their genomes don’t encode for a lot of proteins.\nThat said, viruses must utilize host cell machinery to survive - they also maintain close contact with cells. So, scientists need to grow viruses in cells to study them. All viruses also follow certain steps (see below) to make copies of themselves - these steps are similar for all viruses.\n\n1.2.1 Stages of Virus Replication\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneral Schematic of How Viruses Replicate Using a Paramyxovirus\n\n\n\n\nThe basic stages (using the paramyxovirus) include:\n\nAttachment and Entry Uncoating\nViruses stick to cells to get in them. They then release their genetic material when they’re inside the cell.\nReplication and Transcription\nThe virus’ genetic material takes over the cell’s machinery to make new genetic material and proteins. This creates more virus parts.\nAssembly\nThe genetic material and proteins form new virus particles.\nRelease\nThe virus particles break free from the cell and infect other cells. Everything repeats itself.\n\n\n\n1.2.2 Virus Classification\nThe taxonomic method used to group viruses is polythetic - a virus group is described by its properties. Some properties used to describe viruses include:\n\nMorphology\nThis refers to the virus’ size, shape, capsid symmetry, and whether it has an envelope or not.\n\n\n\n\n\nViruses at Different Sizes\n\n\n\n\nHow big a virus is affects the way it interacts with its host.\nPhysical Properties\nThis refers to the virus’ genome, its response to physical and / or chemical agents, and its antigenic properties.\nBiological Properties\nThis refers to the virus’ replication methods, hosts, transmission modes, and also how infectious it is.\n\nThoguh, the following metrics can be used as well:\n\nGenetic Material\nViruses can also contain RNA instead of DNA.\nGenome Structure\nThey can be single or multiple-copied, single or double stranded (i.e., “ss” or “ds”), and have various orientations (i.e., +ve like mRNA or -ve sense).\nEnveloped or Non-Enveloped Status\nViruses can come with or without lipid envelopes. For those without envelopes, they have a capsid structure and have Icosahedral symmetry (i.e., two, three, and five-fold symmetry).\n\n\n\n\n\nA Virus with a Lipid Envelope\n\n\n\n\nViruses that have envelopes have something called a lipid bilayer surrounding them. Spike proteins - “little arms” that stick out from the bilayer are usually found too; the arms can help the virus anchor onto surfaces.\n\n\n\n1.2.3 Virus Taxonomy\nScientists who study viruses use a system by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (i.e., ICTV) to organize and name them. The system starts with the biggest group “order” before going down to more specific sub-levels (i.e., “class”, “order”, “family”, etc). There are also special rules for naming and writing descriptions for viruses.\nFor instance, the human respiratory syncytial virus (i.e., RSV) can be classified using this system as:\n\nIt’s in the “Mononegavirales” order\nIt’s in the “Paramyxoviridae” family\nIt’s in the “Pneumovirinae” subfamily\nIt’s in the “Pneumovirus” genus\nIt’s called “Human respiratory syncytial virus” as a species\n\nScientists also tell viruses apart by looking at their genetic sequences. For instance, there’s a type of RSV called “RSV A2” and another called “RSV Long Isolates”."

The amount of bacteria in the human stomach is weighs about a kilogram and the average human adult will poop their own weight in bacteria each year. 8% of viral DNA also comes from what is left of viral genomes.\nThere are about 1400 types of disease-causing organisms that affect humans, for instance, fungi, bacteria, viruses, and more. Yet, these organisms also make up less than a percent of all the microbes on Earth. Scientists think that there could be 120000 to millions of different microbe species in total and that we’ve only studied an incredibly small portion of DNA on Earth1.\n\n1.3.1 Natural Reservoirs of Human Infection\n\n\n\n\n\nSome Examples of Virus Reservoirs\n\n\n\n\nViruses can live inside hosts. An infection happens when the virus jumps ship from a host to another person who isn’t infected. The source of virus infections is a significant factor in controlling diseases."

    "text": "1.4 What Does the Future Hold?\n\n\n\n\n\nPolio Hieroglyphs from Ancient Egypt\n\n\n\n\nExperts think that the first ever record of a viral infection was in a hieroglyph from Memphis - ancient Egypt’s capital - from about 3700 BCE. In this hieroglyph, Ruma - a temple priest - is showing signs of paralytic poliomyelitis.\n\n\n\n\n\nSmallpox on an Egyptian Mummy\n\n\n\n\nThere’s also reason to believe that a smallpox outbreak happened in Ancient Egypt, 1157 BC. There’s evidence of smallpox on Ramses V’s mummy.\n\n1.4.1 First Steps to Understanding Viruses\nApproaches have been devised in the past to deal with viruses and other infectious diseases:\n\nVariolation\n\n\n\n\n\nAn Ancient Chinese Physician Variolating a Person\n\n\n\n\nThe ancient Chinese inhaled dried scabs from smallpox survivors while the Turks and the Europeans used pus from a lesion. This was based on the observation that smallpox survivors were immune to subsequent smallpox infections.\nVaccination\n\n\n\n\n\nEdward Jenner Vaccinating a Young Boy Against Smallpox\n\n\n\n\nEdward Jenner noticed that milkmaids who contracted cowpox - a milder variant of smallpox - do not contract smallpox.\nSo, he suggestd infecting people with cowpox to make someone immune against smallpox. Jenner would then go ahead and infect a young boy with cowpox lesions; he would then go ahead and expose the boy to smallpox a couple of days later.\nAlthough his work was initially met with ridicule, it was eventually met with acceptance.\nFurther Attempts\nBack in 1892, a scientist named Dmitri Iwanowski found that something from sick tobacco plants could make healthy plants sick too. This “something” could pass through filters that catch small things.\nThen, in 1898, Freidrich Loeffler and Paul Frosch discovered that a similar tiny thing caused foot-and-mouth disease in cattle. So these things weren’t just affecting plants, they were causing problems in animals too.\nLater, in 1908, Karl Landsteiner and Erwin Popper showed that poliomyelitis, a disease that affects the nerves, was also caused by one of these tiny things. This was the first time we realized that viruses could infect not only animals but humans as well.\n\nIn 1915, a scientist named Frederick Twort was the first to notice viruses that can infect bacteria\n\n\n1.4.2 Beginning of Molecular Virology\nIn 1977, Frederick Sanger and his team figured out the whole order of 5,375 building blocks (nucleotides) in the genome of a virus called bacteriophage fX174. This was a big deal and they even won the Nobel Prize in 1980 for it. This was the very first time anyone had completely figured out the order of all the parts in a living thing’s genome.\nThen, in 1983, scientists Luc Montagnier and Robert Gallo made a huge announcement. They found a virus named human immunodeficiency virus (i.e., HIV) which causes AIDS. This happened just two years after AIDS started spreading, so it was a quick discovery."

Different tags glow different colors, and this information is useful to help scientists identify what they see.\nThis kind of microscopy can help scientists see parts of viruses in the context of cellular compartments.

These cells are kept alive and healthy under certain conditions.\nScientists create viruses that have a protein that glows (i.e., a little “light bulb”) and they can also create cells that produce glowing proteins. This enables scientists to see what is happening inside the cells at the moment."

    "text": "2.2 Electron Microscopy\n\n\n\n\n\nA Transmission Electron Microscope and a Scanning Electron Microscope\n\n\n\n\nUsing an electron microscope is a complicated deal and one needs expertise to operate and prepare samples. On one hand, electron microscopes can magnify and show a lot of tiny details, but there’s a downside to this: the microscope works in a vacuum - a space without air - so samples need to be dry.\nScientists use these techniques to see things up close using special labels. They attach tiny gold particles to antibodies, and these antibodies can be seen under the microscope and identify specific parts in the samples that they’re looking at.\n\n2.2.1 Scanning Electron Microscopy (i.e., SEM)\n\n\n\n\n\nExamples of Samples Viewed using Scanning Electron Microscopy\n\n\n\n\nScanning electron microscopy (i.e., SEM) is a method used to look at the outside of cells or bigger parts like viruses. Cells are first treated with something called critical point drying to make sure that they’re ready for the microscope.\n\n\n\n\n\nOutline of How SEM Works\n\n\n\n\nThe above figure outlines how SEM typically works:\n\nFixation\nScientist ensure that the cells or samples are fixed. This is almost like taking a picture to ensure that everything stays still.\nDrying\nWater is removed from the samples. Water can mess up the microscope.\nCritical Point Drying\nThis is akin to freeze-drying, but is a technique that helps keep the samples in a good shape for the microscope.\nCoating\nThe sample is coated with a thin layer of a special material - usually metal - to make the samples stronger and ready for the microscope.\nSEM Analysis\nThe sample is put into a SEM - this microscope uses special light to take a super close-up picture of the samples. Scientists can then study these pictures to know more about what it is that they’re looking at.\n\n\n\n2.2.2 Transmission Electron Microscopy (i.e., TEM)\n\n2.2.2.1 Negative Staining\nNegative staining is a way to look at virus particles, their morphology, and detect viruses in clinical material. In this setup, special heavy metals make the virus parts stand out more. Uranyl acetate and phosphotungstic acid are two common choices; these agents don’t color the virus, but they make them easier to see under an electron microscope.\nScientists also use a special grid to look at the viruses under the electron microscope.\n\n\n\n\n\nOutline of How TEM Works\n\n\n\n\nThe above figure outlines how TEM works:\n\nAdding Sample to Buffer\nSamples are added to a special liquid called a buffer - this helps keep sample safe and ready for the following step.\nAdding Heavy Metal Stain\nA special “paint” made out of heavy metals is added to the sample - this helps the microscope see the sample better by giving it strong contrasts (i.e., like dark ink on white paper).\nBlotting\nThe sample is put onto a special surface that soaks up the extra liquid.\nAir Drying\nThe sample is left in the air to dry. This helps the heavy metal paint to stick to the sample and make it ready for viewing.\n\n\n\n2.2.2.2 Immuno-Negative Staining\nWhen negative staining is performed with immunolabelling, this is called immuno-negative staining. First, immunolabelling - putting special “labels” on the objects of interests - is carried out. Then, negative staining is carried out to make the sample easier to look at.\n\n\n2.2.2.3 Thin Sections\nTo study samples closely, scientists need to prepare them carefully:\n\nFirst, they make the cells stay still using a process called fixation.\nThey treat the cells with chemicals and then remove water from them.\nThey put the cells into a special plastic material to keep them in shape. To see virus-infected cells, they need to cut super thin slices, like cutting very thin pieces of cheese. These slices are usually between 80 and 100 nanometers thick.\nThey use a special machine called an ultramicrotome to do this cutting. Once the slices are ready, they put them on a small grid and add some coloring to help see the details better when they use the electron microscope.\n\nSamples can also be immunolabelled before or after embedding (i.e., keeping the cells into a special plastic material) and sectioning."

    "section": "3.1 Virus Attachment",
    "text": "3.1 Virus Attachment\nWhen a virus wants to get into a cell, it starts by attaching itself to the cell’s surface. This only works if the virus can connect with certain cell surface parts called receptors. It’s the initial step in the process.\n\n3.1.1 Attachment for Enveloped Viruses\n\n\n\n\n\nTypes of Spikes Used by Enveloped Viruses\n\n\n\n\nViruses use their proteins to attach to cells. Viruses with envelopes do this wtih spikes on their surface. There are two types of these spikes covered in this course:\n\nType I\nExamples are HIV’s gp120 and the HA protein in influenza viruses.\nType II\nThis includes the G protein in paramyxoviruses.\n\n\n\n3.1.2 Non-Enveloped Viruses\nNon-enveloped viruses have a different way of attaching to cells. They use parts that stick out from their outer shell, called the capsid. These parts can be:\n\nProjections\n\n\n\n\n\nCapsid Projections in the Adenovirus\n\n\n\n\nLike the trimeric fiber proteins in Adenovirus.\nRegions\n\n\n\n\n\nCapsid Protein C\n\n\n\n\nSome parts of the capsid protein, such as the “canyon” in picornaviruses.\n\n\n\n3.1.3 Cell Receptors\nViruses use cell receptors to stick to cells. These are like keys that fit into specific locks on the cell’s surface. There are two main types of receptors: proteins and carbohydrates.\nViruses can connect to primary receptors, which are like main locks, and sometimes to secondary receptors, which are like extra locks. For example, HIV-1 uses CD4 as its main lock, and CCR5 is like an extra lock.\n\n3.1.3.1 Protein Receptors\n\n\n\n\n\nVarious Types of Protein Receptors on Host Cells\n\n\n\n\nThere are many different molecules on the surface of cells that act like doors for viruses.\nSome of these molecules don’t seem to do anything else (e.g., PVR for Poliovirus), while others have a specific job (e.g., CD55 for Echovirus, which helps with the immune system).\n\n3.1.3.1.1 Identifying Protein Receptors\nThere are several ways:\n\nUsing Specific Monoclonal Antibodies\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing Antibodies to Detect Virus Binding\n\n\n\n\nOne way is by using specific monoclonal antibodies, which are like tiny soldiers that target and block the virus from sticking to the receptor. Another method is to use a receptor in a soluble form, like a decoy, to catch the virus before it attaches. Lastly, researchers might use a receptor antagonist, which is like a blocker, to prevent the virus from binding to the receptor.\nTo see if the virus is there, scientists can use something called ELISA, which is a bit like a virus detector test for the cell’s surface.\nVirus Overlay Protein Blot Assay\n\n\n\n\n\nA Schematic of a Blot Assay\n\n\n\n\nIt’s a bit like when placing a sticker on a piece of paper. The virus sticks to these proteins that are put on a special paper. For example, the lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus sticks to a protein called α-dystroglycan that’s on the paper. This helps scientists understand how viruses attach to cells.\n\n\n\n\n3.1.3.2 Carbohydrate Receptors\n\n\n\n\n\nExamples of Carbohydrate Receptors\n\n\n\n\nCertain viruses have developed a clever strategy – they’ve learned to attach to carbohydrate molecules on the surface of cells. These carbohydrates are like flags on the cells, made of special sugars. These flags are found on proteins and fats on the cell’s surface. The fascinating thing is that these flags are present on cells from various animals. So, these viruses can infect a wide range of hosts, kind of like having a key that fits many different locks.\n\n3.1.3.2.1 Identifyign Carbohydrate Receptors\nThere are three main ways:\n\nVirus Protein Properties\n\n\n\n\n\nA Schematic of the Sendai (i.e., Paramyxovirus) Virus\n\n\n\n\nSometimes, the characteristics of certain virus proteins can provide hints about how they work.\nFor instance, some viruses have proteins with sugar molecules attached (glycoproteins), and these proteins can do interesting things. For example, the attachment protein (HN) in the Sendai virus has a special ability called neuraminidase activity, which suggests that a sugar molecule called sialic acid might be really important for the virus to stick to cells.\nEnzymes that Remove or Destroy a type of Carbohydrate\n\n\n\n\n\nDestroying a Certain Kind of Carbohydrate\n\n\n\n\nThere are enzymes that can do just that! One of these enzymes is called neuraminidase (NA), and it works by removing a particular kind of sugar molecule called sialic acid from the cell’s surface.\nThis sugar is like a lock that the influenza A virus uses to attach to cells. When we use neuraminidase to take away this lock, the virus can’t get in. This is like having a way to break the virus’s key, so it can’t open the cell’s door anymore.\nAntibodies to Block Virus Attachment\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing Proteins to Inhibit Virus Binding\n\n\n\n\nThink of antibodies as tiny warriors that can fight against viruses. Some antibodies are really good at stopping viruses from attaching to cells. For instance, there’s a specific antibody called anti-galactosyl ceramide that can act like a shield to block HIV from infecting cells. It’s like having a superhero shield that stops the virus from getting close to the cell’s entrance.\n\n\n\n\n\n3.1.4 Why Target Virus Receptors?\nFinding out about virus receptors is like discovering the virus’s weak point. When we know which parts of cells the virus uses to attach, we can figure out how to stop it. This means we might be able to prevent the virus from getting into cells in the first place. There are different ways to do this, like using special antibodies that can neutralize the virus or using a kind of decoy - a soluble form of the receptor - that tricks the virus into attaching to it instead of the real cells. It’s like setting up traps to catch the virus before it can cause harm."

To do this, the virus triggers certain signals that help it get inside the cell. It’s like the virus is sending messages to open the cell’s door. When the virus first connects with the receptor, it can set off a chain reaction of signals.\n\n\n\n\n\nVarious Cell Structures in Virus Entry\n\n\n\n\nFor example, the Adenovirus uses a receptor called integrin a2b3. When this connection happens, it’s like pressing a button that activates different processes inside the cell. This includes things like PI3K getting activated, which is like starting a car’s engine. Then, molecules like PIP3 work like fuel, making another process called rho GTPases start. This process changes the cell’s shape, helping the virus get inside. It’s kind of like the virus is using a series of switches and levers to open a secret door into the cell."

    "text": "3.3 Virus Entry\nEnveloped viruses have two main ways to enter cells. First, they can fuse their outer layer with the cell’s outer layer, like two bubbles merging. Second, they can hitch a ride inside the cell through a process called receptor-mediated endocytosis, like a Trojan horse sneaking in.\nOn the other hand, non-enveloped viruses use different tactics to get inside cells. For example, the poliovirus changes its shape when it connects to a receptor (i.e., A particles), creating a tiny hole in the endosome where it’s trapped. Through this hole, the virus’s genetic material can slip into the cell, a bit like a secret passage being unlocked.\n\n3.3.1 Viral Fusion Proteins\n\n\n\n\n\nActivation of a Viral Fusion Protein via Proteolysis\n\n\n\n\nVirus fusion proteins are a special kind of membrane protein that help viruses merge their outer layer with a cell’s outer layer. Some examples are the influenza virus’s hemagglutinin (HA), SARS CoV-2’s S protein, and dengue virus’s E protein.\nThese proteins usually start in a quiet state, not ready to fuse. But then, they change into an active form, like waking up, thanks to certain actions like proteolysis. Another trigger then turns this active form into the even more active “fusogenic” form.\nIn this supercharged state, a part of the protein that doesn’t like water gets stuck into the cell’s outer layer. The fusion protein then twists and changes shape, making the virus and cell outer layers join together, a bit like a zipper closing.\n\n\n3.3.2 Mechanisms by Enveloped Viruses\n\n\n\n\n\npH Dependent and pH Independent Viruses\n\n\n\n\nThere are two ways enveloped viruses can enter cells: ones that care about pH and ones that don’t. We can tell the difference by using special compounds like chloroquine and monensin, which stop acidic stuff in the endosomes from working. The way a virus enters depends on its fusion protein, a bit like how different keys fit different locks.\n\n3.3.2.1 Example of a pH Dependent Mechanism\n\n\n\n\n\nHA Helping an Influenza Virus Gain Entry into a Cell\n\n\n\n\nFirst, the virus sticks to a receptor called sialic acid, and the cell brings it inside using endocytosis, like a package delivery.\nInside the cell, the endosome’s pH becomes more acidic, like a lemon. This acid bath causes a transformation in the virus’s hemagglutinin (i.e., HA) protein. It goes from a quiet state to a supercharged one, ready to fuse. This HA now acts like a bridge between the virus and the endosomal membrane. It pulls them together, making them become one, like joining two puzzle pieces.\n\n\n3.3.2.2 Example of a pH Independent Mechanism\n\n\n\n\n\nSendai Virus Gaining Entry into a Cell\n\n\n\n\nFusion happens at a normal pH, like the one in our bodies, and it’s controlled by a special virus protein called the fusion (F) protein.\nThe process begins with the virus attachment protein (HN) connecting to the cell’s receptor (sialic acid). This connection makes the HN change shape. This shape change then causes the F protein to also change shape. Think of it like a domino effect: the first domino (HN) falls, which makes the second one (F protein) tip over. This change in the F protein is like a key turning in a lock, allowing the virus and cell membranes to fuse together, a bit like two soap bubbles merging.\n\n\n3.3.2.3 Cell-to-Cell Fusion Virus Transmission\n\n\n\n\n\nViral Fusion Transmission\n\n\n\n\nSometimes, infection can happen in a unique way: the outer shell of an infected cell fuses directly with an uninfected cell’s outer shell.\nThis fusion can lead to the creation of big cells with multiple nuclei, kind of like cells joining together to form a team. This is seen in various tissues and cells.\nA group of viruses called paramyxoviruses, such as the respiratory syncytial virus, are known to cause this kind of fusion. It’s like the viruses are playing a trick, making cells merge and work together, but it’s not for the good – it helps the virus spread.\n\n\n\n3.3.3 Mechanisms by Non-Enveloped Viruses\nNon-enveloped viruses have another way to get their genetic material into cells.\nOne way is by creating a protein-made pore in the cell’s outer layer. Think of it like poking a small hole in a balloon.\nAnother way is by messing up the cell’s outer layer when the virus is taken inside through endocytosis. It’s like opening a door, but making a bit of a mess in the process. This helps the virus get its genetic material where it needs to go.\n\n3.3.3.1 Example: Poliovirus Uncoating\n\n\n\n\n\nPoliovirus Uncoating Mechanism\n\n\n\n\nPoliovirus goes through a series of shape changes when it meets the cell’s surface. These changes help the virus send its genetic material inside the cell.\nScientists can tell these different forms apart by how they behave when spun in a machine called a centrifuge. It’s like sorting different types of beads by spinning them really fast – each type settles at a different level."

    "text": "3.4 Intracellular Trafficking\nTo move their capsids around inside the cell, viruses use special transport systems within the cytoplasm.\nFor short distances near the cell’s surface, they travel along actin filaments. It’s like taking a short walk around the neighborhood.\nFor longer journeys, they use microtubules. These are like highways within the cell. Imagine driving a longer distance on a big road.\nThese capsids can hitch rides in endocytic vesicles, like getting inside small vehicles. They then travel through the cell’s interior, where they link up with tiny motors like dynein. These motors help them move, a bit like being pulled along by a tiny train."

    "text": "3.5 Uncoating\nUncoating is the last step of the entry process, where the virus sets its genetic material free into the cell’s center. This genetic material is enclosed by a matrix protein.\nThe matrix protein gets separated from the genetic material through a process where the virus’s interior becomes more acidic. This acidification is helped by a protein called M2 that the virus carries with it. It’s like the virus has a special key that makes the interior more acidic, and this helps unlock the genetic material from the matrix protein.\n\n3.5.1 Example: Influenza Virus\n\n\n\n\n\nUncoating of the Influenza Virus\n\n\n\n\nWhen it comes to influenza virus, uncoating involves a specific process. The M2 ion channel, acting like a tiny gate, lets protons from the endosome into the virus. This makes the virus’s insides more acidic, which helps break apart the connection between the M1 protein and the ribonucleoproteins (RNPs, which carry the genetic material).\nThis process is quite important for designing antiviral drugs. For instance, amantadine is a drug that interferes with the activity of the M2 protein. By blocking the M2 protein’s function, it’s like putting a lock on that tiny gate and preventing the virus from undergoing the uncoating process effectively."

    "text": "3.6 Nuclear Import\nSome viruses, both those made of DNA and a few from RNA, carry out their replication inside the cell’s nucleus.\nFor this to happen, the virus’s genetic material and its accompanying proteins have to get inside the nucleus through something called the nuclear pore complex (i.e., NPC).\nThis transport through the NPC involves a series of steps:\n\nThe virus has to move from the cytosol to the nucleus.\nIt needs to bind to the NPC, like finding the right door.\nIt has to pass through the pore itself.\nImportantly, the virus proteins need to have a Nuclear Localization Signal (i.e., NLS) so that importin proteins can recognize them. This NLS acts like a passport that allows the virus proteins entry into the nucleus. This process can also affect the virus’s ability to infect different hosts, like how the flu virus’s host range might be determined in part by whether its proteins can be recognized by importin proteins.\n\nNPCs have a diameter of about 39 nanometers. Only the smallest virus capsids, such as Parvovirus, can fit through without any changes. However, larger viruses face a challenge due to their big size. They need to undergo some changes, like taking off a piece of their outer layer.\n\n\n\n\n\nVarious Viruses’ Nuclear Import Mechanism\n\n\n\n\nFor example, the adenovirus changes its structure a bit and attaches to specific parts of the NPC, allowing its DNA to slip through. In the case of viruses like HSV (herpes simplex virus), they have special proteins that help them grab onto the NPC, and this helps their DNA get inside the nucleus. For viruses like influenza, which has a segmented genome, the individual segments (kind of like puzzle pieces) go through the NPC one by one. It’s like getting a large piece of furniture through a narrow doorway by taking it apart and reassembling it inside."
