    "section": "1.2 What is a Virus?",
    "text": "1.2 What is a Virus?\nViruses were originally said to be tiny objects that can pass through filters (unlike bacteria), but nonetheless, a virus is a tiny particle that has genetic material, a protein shell, and sometimes, a fatty covering.\nViruses can be differerently complex in terms of their genetic or molecular makeup, but their genomes don’t encode for a lot of proteins.\nThat said, viruses must utilize host cell machinery to survive - they also maintain close contact with cells. So, scientists need to grow viruses in cells to study them. All viruses also follow certain steps (see below) to make copies of themselves - these steps are similar for all viruses.\n\n1.2.1 Stages of Virus Replication\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneral Schematic of How Viruses Replicate Using a Paramyxovirus\n\n\n\n\nThe basic stages (using the paramyxovirus) include:\n\nAttachment and Entry Uncoating\nViruses stick to cells to get in them. They then release their genetic material when they’re inside the cell.\nReplication and Transcription\nThe virus’ genetic material takes over the cell’s machinery to make new genetic material and proteins. This creates more virus parts.\nAssembly\nThe genetic material and proteins form new virus particles.\nRelease\nThe virus particles break free from the cell and infect other cells. Everything repeats itself.\n\n\n\n1.2.2 Virus Classification\nThe taxonomic method used to group viruses is polythetic - a virus group is described by its properties. Some properties used to describe viruses include:\n\nMorphology\nThis refers to the virus’ size, shape, capsid symmetry, and whether it has an envelope or not.\n\n\n\n\n\nViruses at Different Sizes\n\n\n\n\nHow big a virus is affects the way it interacts with its host.\nPhysical Properties\nThis refers to the virus’ genome, its response to physical and / or chemical agents, and its antigenic properties.\nBiological Properties\nThis refers to the virus’ replication methods, hosts, transmission modes, and also how infectious it is.\n\nThoguh, the following metrics can be used as well:\n\nGenetic Material\nViruses can also contain RNA instead of DNA.\nGenome Structure\nThey can be single or multiple-copied, single or double stranded (i.e., “ss” or “ds”), and have various orientations (i.e., +ve like mRNA or -ve sense).\nEnveloped or Non-Enveloped Status\nViruses can come with or without lipid envelopes. For those without envelopes, they have a capsid structure and have Icosahedral symmetry (i.e., two, three, and five-fold symmetry).\n\n\n\n\n\nA Virus with a Lipid Envelope\n\n\n\n\nViruses that have envelopes have something called a lipid bilayer surrounding them. Spike proteins - “little arms” that stick out from the bilayer are usually found too; the arms can help the virus anchor onto surfaces.\n\n\n\n1.2.3 Virus Taxonomy\nScientists who study viruses use a system by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (i.e., ICTV) to organize and name them. The system starts with the biggest group “order” before going down to more specific sub-levels (i.e., “class”, “order”, “family”, etc). There are also special rules for naming and writing descriptions for viruses.\nFor instance, the human respiratory syncytial virus (i.e., RSV) can be classified using this system as:\n\nIt’s in the “Mononegavirales” order\nIt’s in the “Paramyxoviridae” family\nIt’s in the “Pneumovirinae” subfamily\nIt’s in the “Pneumovirus” genus\nIt’s called “Human respiratory syncytial virus” as a species\n\nScientists also tell viruses apart by looking at their genetic sequences. For instance, there’s a type of RSV called “RSV A2” and another called “RSV Long Isolates”."

The amount of bacteria in the human stomach is weighs about a kilogram and the average human adult will poop their own weight in bacteria each year. 8% of viral DNA also comes from what is left of viral genomes.\nThere are about 1400 types of disease-causing organisms that affect humans, for instance, fungi, bacteria, viruses, and more. Yet, these organisms also make up less than a percent of all the microbes on Earth. Scientists think that there could be 120000 to millions of different microbe species in total and that we’ve only studied an incredibly small portion of DNA on Earth1.\n\n1.3.1 Natural Reservoirs of Human Infection\n\n\n\n\n\nSome Examples of Virus Reservoirs\n\n\n\n\nViruses can live inside hosts. An infection happens when the virus jumps ship from a host to another person who isn’t infected. The source of virus infections is a significant factor in controlling diseases."

    "text": "1.4 What Does the Future Hold?\n\n\n\n\n\nPolio Hieroglyphs from Ancient Egypt\n\n\n\n\nExperts think that the first ever record of a viral infection was in a hieroglyph from Memphis - ancient Egypt’s capital - from about 3700 BCE. In this hieroglyph, Ruma - a temple priest - is showing signs of paralytic poliomyelitis.\n\n\n\n\n\nSmallpox on an Egyptian Mummy\n\n\n\n\nThere’s also reason to believe that a smallpox outbreak happened in Ancient Egypt, 1157 BC. There’s evidence of smallpox on Ramses V’s mummy.\n\n1.4.1 First Steps to Understanding Viruses\nApproaches have been devised in the past to deal with viruses and other infectious diseases:\n\nVariolation\n\n\n\n\n\nAn Ancient Chinese Physician Variolating a Person\n\n\n\n\nThe ancient Chinese inhaled dried scabs from smallpox survivors while the Turks and the Europeans used pus from a lesion. This was based on the observation that smallpox survivors were immune to subsequent smallpox infections.\nVaccination\n\n\n\n\n\nEdward Jenner Vaccinating a Young Boy Against Smallpox\n\n\n\n\nEdward Jenner noticed that milkmaids who contracted cowpox - a milder variant of smallpox - do not contract smallpox.\nSo, he suggestd infecting people with cowpox to make someone immune against smallpox. Jenner would then go ahead and infect a young boy with cowpox lesions; he would then go ahead and expose the boy to smallpox a couple of days later.\nAlthough his work was initially met with ridicule, it was eventually met with acceptance.\nFurther Attempts\nBack in 1892, a scientist named Dmitri Iwanowski found that something from sick tobacco plants could make healthy plants sick too. This “something” could pass through filters that catch small things.\nThen, in 1898, Freidrich Loeffler and Paul Frosch discovered that a similar tiny thing caused foot-and-mouth disease in cattle. So these things weren’t just affecting plants, they were causing problems in animals too.\nLater, in 1908, Karl Landsteiner and Erwin Popper showed that poliomyelitis, a disease that affects the nerves, was also caused by one of these tiny things. This was the first time we realized that viruses could infect not only animals but humans as well.\n\nIn 1915, a scientist named Frederick Twort was the first to notice viruses that can infect bacteria\n\n\n1.4.2 Beginning of Molecular Virology\nIn 1977, Frederick Sanger and his team figured out the whole order of 5,375 building blocks (nucleotides) in the genome of a virus called bacteriophage fX174. This was a big deal and they even won the Nobel Prize in 1980 for it. This was the very first time anyone had completely figured out the order of all the parts in a living thing’s genome.\nThen, in 1983, scientists Luc Montagnier and Robert Gallo made a huge announcement. They found a virus named human immunodeficiency virus (i.e., HIV) which causes AIDS. This happened just two years after AIDS started spreading, so it was a quick discovery."

    "text": "2.1 Virus Attachment\nWhen a virus wants to get into a cell, it starts by attaching itself to the cell’s surface. This only works if the virus can connect with certain cell surface parts called receptors. It’s the initial step in the process.\n\n2.1.1 Attachment for Enveloped Viruses\n\n\n\n\n\nTypes of Spikes Used by Enveloped Viruses\n\n\n\n\nViruses use their proteins to attach to cells. Viruses with envelopes do this wtih spikes on their surface. There are two types of these spikes covered in this course:\n\nType I\nExamples are HIV’s gp120 and the HA protein in influenza viruses.\nType II\nThis includes the G protein in paramyxoviruses.\n\n\n\n2.1.2 Non-Enveloped Viruses\nNon-enveloped viruses have a different way of attaching to cells. They use parts that stick out from their outer shell, called the capsid. These parts can be:\n\nProjections\n\n\n\n\n\nCapsid Projections in the Adenovirus\n\n\n\n\nLike the trimeric fiber proteins in Adenovirus.\nRegions\n\n\n\n\n\nCapsid Protein C\n\n\n\n\nSome parts of the capsid protein, such as the “canyon” in picornaviruses.\n\n\n\n2.1.3 Cell Receptors\nViruses use cell receptors to stick to cells. These are like keys that fit into specific locks on the cell’s surface. There are two main types of receptors: proteins and carbohydrates.\nViruses can connect to primary receptors, which are like main locks, and sometimes to secondary receptors, which are like extra locks. For example, HIV-1 uses CD4 as its main lock, and CCR5 is like an extra lock.\n\n2.1.3.1 Protein Receptors\n\n\n\n\n\nVarious Types of Protein Receptors on Host Cells\n\n\n\n\nThere are many different molecules on the surface of cells that act like doors for viruses.\nSome of these molecules don’t seem to do anything else (e.g., PVR for Poliovirus), while others have a specific job (e.g., CD55 for Echovirus, which helps with the immune system).\n\n2.1.3.1.1 Identifying Protein Receptors\nThere are several ways:\n\nUsing Specific Monoclonal Antibodies\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing Antibodies to Detect Virus Binding\n\n\n\n\nOne way is by using specific monoclonal antibodies, which are like tiny soldiers that target and block the virus from sticking to the receptor. Another method is to use a receptor in a soluble form, like a decoy, to catch the virus before it attaches. Lastly, researchers might use a receptor antagonist, which is like a blocker, to prevent the virus from binding to the receptor.\nTo see if the virus is there, scientists can use something called ELISA, which is a bit like a virus detector test for the cell’s surface.\nVirus Overlay Protein Blot Assay\n\n\n\n\n\nA Schematic of a Blot Assay\n\n\n\n\nIt’s a bit like when placing a sticker on a piece of paper. The virus sticks to these proteins that are put on a special paper. For example, the lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus sticks to a protein called α-dystroglycan that’s on the paper. This helps scientists understand how viruses attach to cells.\n\n\n\n\n2.1.3.2 Carbohydrate Receptors\n\n\n\n\n\nExamples of Carbohydrate Receptors\n\n\n\n\nCertain viruses have developed a clever strategy – they’ve learned to attach to carbohydrate molecules on the surface of cells. These carbohydrates are like flags on the cells, made of special sugars. These flags are found on proteins and fats on the cell’s surface. The fascinating thing is that these flags are present on cells from various animals. So, these viruses can infect a wide range of hosts, kind of like having a key that fits many different locks.\n\n2.1.3.2.1 Identifyign Carbohydrate Receptors\nThere are three main ways:\n\nVirus Protein Properties\n\n\n\n\n\nA Schematic of the Sendai (i.e., Paramyxovirus) Virus\n\n\n\n\nSometimes, the characteristics of certain virus proteins can provide hints about how they work.\nFor instance, some viruses have proteins with sugar molecules attached (glycoproteins), and these proteins can do interesting things. For example, the attachment protein (HN) in the Sendai virus has a special ability called neuraminidase activity, which suggests that a sugar molecule called sialic acid might be really important for the virus to stick to cells.\nEnzymes that Remove or Destroy a type of Carbohydrate\n\n\n\n\n\nDestroying a Certain Kind of Carbohydrate\n\n\n\n\nThere are enzymes that can do just that! One of these enzymes is called neuraminidase (NA), and it works by removing a particular kind of sugar molecule called sialic acid from the cell’s surface.\nThis sugar is like a lock that the influenza A virus uses to attach to cells. When we use neuraminidase to take away this lock, the virus can’t get in. This is like having a way to break the virus’s key, so it can’t open the cell’s door anymore.\nAntibodies to Block Virus Attachment\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing Proteins to Inhibit Virus Binding\n\n\n\n\nThink of antibodies as tiny warriors that can fight against viruses. Some antibodies are really good at stopping viruses from attaching to cells. For instance, there’s a specific antibody called anti-galactosyl ceramide that can act like a shield to block HIV from infecting cells. It’s like having a superhero shield that stops the virus from getting close to the cell’s entrance.\n\n\n\n\n\n2.1.4 Why Target Virus Receptors?\nFinding out about virus receptors is like discovering the virus’s weak point. When we know which parts of cells the virus uses to attach, we can figure out how to stop it. This means we might be able to prevent the virus from getting into cells in the first place. There are different ways to do this, like using special antibodies that can neutralize the virus or using a kind of decoy - a soluble form of the receptor - that tricks the virus into attaching to it instead of the real cells. It’s like setting up traps to catch the virus before it can cause harm."

To do this, the virus triggers certain signals that help it get inside the cell. It’s like the virus is sending messages to open the cell’s door. When the virus first connects with the receptor, it can set off a chain reaction of signals.\n\n\n\n\n\nVarious Cell Structures in Virus Entry\n\n\n\n\nFor example, the Adenovirus uses a receptor called integrin a2b3. When this connection happens, it’s like pressing a button that activates different processes inside the cell. This includes things like PI3K getting activated, which is like starting a car’s engine. Then, molecules like PIP3 work like fuel, making another process called rho GTPases start. This process changes the cell’s shape, helping the virus get inside. It’s kind of like the virus is using a series of switches and levers to open a secret door into the cell."

    "section": "2.3 Virus Entry",
    "text": "2.3 Virus Entry\nEnveloped viruses have two main ways to enter cells. First, they can fuse their outer layer with the cell’s outer layer, like two bubbles merging. Second, they can hitch a ride inside the cell through a process called receptor-mediated endocytosis, like a Trojan horse sneaking in.\nOn the other hand, non-enveloped viruses use different tactics to get inside cells. For example, the poliovirus changes its shape when it connects to a receptor (i.e., A particles), creating a tiny hole in the endosome where it’s trapped. Through this hole, the virus’s genetic material can slip into the cell, a bit like a secret passage being unlocked.\n\n2.3.1 Viral Fusion Proteins\n\n\n\n\n\nActivation of a Viral Fusion Protein via Proteolysis\n\n\n\n\nVirus fusion proteins are a special kind of membrane protein that help viruses merge their outer layer with a cell’s outer layer. Some examples are the influenza virus’s hemagglutinin (HA), SARS CoV-2’s S protein, and dengue virus’s E protein.\nThese proteins usually start in a quiet state, not ready to fuse. But then, they change into an active form, like waking up, thanks to certain actions like proteolysis. Another trigger then turns this active form into the even more active “fusogenic” form.\nIn this supercharged state, a part of the protein that doesn’t like water gets stuck into the cell’s outer layer. The fusion protein then twists and changes shape, making the virus and cell outer layers join together, a bit like a zipper closing.\n\n\n2.3.2 Mechanisms by Enveloped Viruses\n\n\n\n\n\npH Dependent and pH Independent Viruses\n\n\n\n\nThere are two ways enveloped viruses can enter cells: ones that care about pH and ones that don’t. We can tell the difference by using special compounds like chloroquine and monensin, which stop acidic stuff in the endosomes from working. The way a virus enters depends on its fusion protein, a bit like how different keys fit different locks.\n\n2.3.2.1 Example of a pH Dependent Mechanism\n\n\n\n\n\nHA Helping an Influenza Virus Gain Entry into a Cell\n\n\n\n\nFirst, the virus sticks to a receptor called sialic acid, and the cell brings it inside using endocytosis, like a package delivery.\nInside the cell, the endosome’s pH becomes more acidic, like a lemon. This acid bath causes a transformation in the virus’s hemagglutinin (i.e., HA) protein. It goes from a quiet state to a supercharged one, ready to fuse. This HA now acts like a bridge between the virus and the endosomal membrane. It pulls them together, making them become one, like joining two puzzle pieces.\n\n\n2.3.2.2 Example of a pH Independent Mechanism\n\n\n\n\n\nSendai Virus Gaining Entry into a Cell\n\n\n\n\nFusion happens at a normal pH, like the one in our bodies, and it’s controlled by a special virus protein called the fusion (F) protein.\nThe process begins with the virus attachment protein (HN) connecting to the cell’s receptor (sialic acid). This connection makes the HN change shape. This shape change then causes the F protein to also change shape. Think of it like a domino effect: the first domino (HN) falls, which makes the second one (F protein) tip over. This change in the F protein is like a key turning in a lock, allowing the virus and cell membranes to fuse together, a bit like two soap bubbles merging.\n\n\n2.3.2.3 Cell-to-Cell Fusion Virus Transmission\n\n\n\n\n\nViral Fusion Transmission\n\n\n\n\nSometimes, infection can happen in a unique way: the outer shell of an infected cell fuses directly with an uninfected cell’s outer shell.\nThis fusion can lead to the creation of big cells with multiple nuclei, kind of like cells joining together to form a team. This is seen in various tissues and cells.\nA group of viruses called paramyxoviruses, such as the respiratory syncytial virus, are known to cause this kind of fusion. It’s like the viruses are playing a trick, making cells merge and work together, but it’s not for the good – it helps the virus spread.\n\n\n\n2.3.3 Mechanisms by Non-Enveloped Viruses\nNon-enveloped viruses have another way to get their genetic material into cells.\nOne way is by creating a protein-made pore in the cell’s outer layer. Think of it like poking a small hole in a balloon.\nAnother way is by messing up the cell’s outer layer when the virus is taken inside through endocytosis. It’s like opening a door, but making a bit of a mess in the process. This helps the virus get its genetic material where it needs to go.\n\n2.3.3.1 Example: Poliovirus Uncoating\n\n\n\n\n\nPoliovirus Uncoating Mechanism\n\n\n\n\nPoliovirus goes through a series of shape changes when it meets the cell’s surface. These changes help the virus send its genetic material inside the cell.\nScientists can tell these different forms apart by how they behave when spun in a machine called a centrifuge. It’s like sorting different types of beads by spinning them really fast – each type settles at a different level."

Imagine driving a longer distance on a big road.\nThese capsids can hitch rides in endocytic vesicles, like getting inside small vehicles. They then travel through the cell’s interior, where they link up with tiny motors like dynein. These motors help them move, a bit like being pulled along by a tiny train."

This genetic material is enclosed by a matrix protein.\nThe matrix protein gets separated from the genetic material through a process where the virus’s interior becomes more acidic. This acidification is helped by a protein called M2 that the virus carries with it. It’s like the virus has a special key that makes the interior more acidic, and this helps unlock the genetic material from the matrix protein.\n\n2.5.1 Example: Influenza Virus\n\n\n\n\n\nUncoating of the Influenza Virus\n\n\n\n\nWhen it comes to influenza virus, uncoating involves a specific process. The M2 ion channel, acting like a tiny gate, lets protons from the endosome into the virus. This makes the virus’s insides more acidic, which helps break apart the connection between the M1 protein and the ribonucleoproteins (RNPs, which carry the genetic material).\nThis process is quite important for designing antiviral drugs. For instance, amantadine is a drug that interferes with the activity of the M2 protein. By blocking the M2 protein’s function, it’s like putting a lock on that tiny gate and preventing the virus from undergoing the uncoating process effectively."

This NLS acts like a passport that allows the virus proteins entry into the nucleus. This process can also affect the virus’s ability to infect different hosts, like how the flu virus’s host range might be determined in part by whether its proteins can be recognized by importin proteins.\n\nNPCs have a diameter of about 39 nanometers. Only the smallest virus capsids, such as Parvovirus, can fit through without any changes. However, larger viruses face a challenge due to their big size. They need to undergo some changes, like taking off a piece of their outer layer.\n\n\n\n\n\nVarious Viruses’ Nuclear Import Mechanism\n\n\n\n\nFor example, the adenovirus changes its structure a bit and attaches to specific parts of the NPC, allowing its DNA to slip through. In the case of viruses like HSV (herpes simplex virus), they have special proteins that help them grab onto the NPC, and this helps their DNA get inside the nucleus. For viruses like influenza, which has a segmented genome, the individual segments (kind of like puzzle pieces) go through the NPC one by one. It’s like getting a large piece of furniture through a narrow doorway by taking it apart and reassembling it inside."

Moreover, it can have single or double strands, and its shape can be linear or circular. The way the genetic material reads can also be single-stranded, double-stranded, or a mix of both (i.e., ambisense polarity). In terms of numbers, there are more double-stranded DNA viruses compared to single-stranded DNA viruses, while there are more single-stranded RNA viruses than double-stranded RNA viruses. Additionally, virus genomes can be either single segments or divided into multiple segments.\nWhere the genome replication takes place can vary as well, with some happening in the cell nucleus and others in the cytoplasm. Most DNA viruses replicate their genome in the cell nucleus, whereas most RNA viruses do so in the cytoplasm. The structure of the genome has an impact on how the virus itself is structured. For instance, in certain viruses, an enzyme called polymerase needs to be packed together with the virus’s genetic material.\nWhen it comes to DNA viruses, their genomes can differ in size. There are small ones, like parvovirus, with genomes of up to 9,000 bases, intermediate-sized ones around 35,000 bases, such as Adenoviruses, and larger ones ranging from 130,000 to 350,000 bases, like the Herpes virus. The larger DNA viruses even have the capacity to encode enzymes involved in DNA synthesis (polymerases) and factors that control transcription processes.\n\n3.1.1 DNA Viruses\nDNA viruses have different sizes for their genetic information. Some have small genomes, like the parvovirus, which can be up to 9,000 bases long. Then there are those with intermediate-sized genomes, like Adenoviruses, which are around 35,000 bases in length. On the larger end of the spectrum, there are viruses like the Herpes virus, which have genomes ranging from 130,000 to 350,000 bases. The interesting thing about these larger viruses is that they’re capable of carrying extra genetic instructions for important tasks like producing polymerase enzymes and factors that help regulate the process of transcription.\n\n3.1.1.1 Regulating Gene Expression\nThe way DNA viruses control the information in their genes is quite intriguing. They manage their gene expression in a couple of distinctive phases. One of these phases is called early gene expression, and it involves a group of genes that are not related to the structure of the virus but are crucial for tasks like copying the viral DNA and changing the cell’s environment to favor the virus. Then there’s “late gene expression,” which handles genes responsible for constructing the virus’s structural components.\nDNA viruses also have this switch between early and late gene expression. In the early phase, the genes responsible for kick-starting important reactions tend to be active, even though their expression might not be very intense. This early stage focuses on producing the essential building blocks. But when it comes to the late phase, the genes that create the structural parts of the virus, like its outer shell, become more active. This is because a lot more of these structural components are required.\nInterestingly, certain viruses, like the Herpes virus, take a middle ground. They have genes that work in between the early and late stages. These genes play a role in controlling the expression of late genes, acting like traffic directors for the production of structural components.\nThis whole process is like a cascade of gene expression, where different genes are turned on and off at different times to ensure the virus can both replicate and assemble its components effectively.\n\n3.1.1.1.1 Further Notes\nGenes have a bit of a helper in their instructions, sort of like a bonus sequence called enhancer sequences. These enhancers make it easier for certain special tools, called factors, to stick to the gene’s instructions and help them work better.\nWhen a virus wants to create certain things at a later stage, it needs the help of things it made early on, like a team effort. These early things and some tools from the cell work together to make the later things happen.\nImagine a virus being a bit of a sneaky character – it can mess with the cell’s work by speeding up the breakdown of the cell’s messages. This makes more room for its own messages, kind of like it’s turning up the volume on its own plans.\nVirus instructions can be read in different places. Most DNA viruses, which are like tiny invaders, use the cell’s own reading machinery found in the cell’s nucleus. But some viruses are a bit different; they hang out and multiply in the cell’s playground (cytoplasm). These viruses bring their own special tools, like little helpers they made themselves, to read their instructions.\n\n\n\n3.1.1.2 How do DNA Viruses Replicate?\n\n\n\n\n\nPhases of the Cell Cycle\n\n\n\n\nA lot of DNA viruses make use of a special tool called the host cell DNA polymerase to copy their own genetic material. This is interesting because the host cell usually copies its DNA during a specific phase called the S phase.\nDNA Viruses use three main ways to replicate:\n\nWaiting for the Cell’s S Phase\n\n\n\n\n\nWaiting for the S Phase to Replicate\n\n\n\n\nImagine DNA viruses like parvovirus as patient waiters. They’re polite viruses that know they need something from the cell to help them replicate. So, they patiently wait for the cell to enter a special phase called the “S phase,” which is like a busy time for the cell when it’s copying its own DNA. During this time, the cell has a special worker called DNA polymerase who’s really good at copying DNA.\nNow, when the cell enters this S phase and starts copying its DNA, the parvovirus sees its chance. It steps up and says, “Hey, can you help me copy my DNA too?” Since the cell’s DNA polymerase is already busy copying the cell’s own DNA, it doesn’t mind helping out the virus at the same time. This way, the virus gets its DNA copied when the cell’s DNA is being copied, making things easier for both the virus and the cell.\nExpressing Early Genes\n\n\n\n\n\nExpressing Early Genes to Cause Cells to Enter S Phase\n\n\n\n\nDNA viruses can sometimes use a sneaky trick to copy themselves. They have some special genes called “early genes,” which can act like switches that tell the cell to start dividing. This phase when the cell starts dividing is called the S phase.\nBy turning on these early genes, the virus kind of tricks the cell into thinking it’s time to divide. This is useful for the virus because during the cell’s S phase, it’s copying its own DNA, and the virus can use the cell’s copying machinery to make copies of itself too.\nSo, viruses like papillomavirus and adenovirus use this trick to make sure they get copied when the cell divides.\nEncoding DNA Replication Enzymes\n\n\n\n\n\nDNA Replication Enzymes\n\n\n\n\nImagine DNA viruses as tiny machines that need to make copies of themselves. Some of these viruses have big instruction manuals (genomes) that are a bit complex. To help with the copying process, these viruses come with their own special tools called DNA replication enzymes.\nThese enzymes, like DNA polymerase and Thymidine kinase, are like super-fast copiers. They read the instructions in the virus’s manual and make exact copies really quickly. This way, the virus can make sure it has plenty of copies to spread around and infect more cells.\nReverse Transcription\n\n\n\n\n\nStructure of the Hepatitis B Virus\n\n\n\n\nImagine the Hepatitis B virus having a unique mechanism, like a special method, for copying its instructions. Instead of having a regular circular DNA, its genetic material is mostly double-stranded and circular, but it’s not fully connected. This type of DNA is called relaxed circular DNA, or rcDNA for short.\nThis rcDNA has two parts: one is the minus-sense DNA strand, which is like the main part of the virus’s instructions. It’s connected to a special protein called the P protein at one end. The other part is the plus-sense DNA strand, which is shorter than the main part. It’s like a shortened version of the instructions. At one end of this shorter strand, there’s something called an RNA primer attached.\nSo, in simple terms, when the Hepatitis B virus wants to make copies of itself, it uses this special rcDNA method. It has one long piece of instructions (minus-sense DNA) connected to a protein, and another shorter piece (plus-sense DNA) with a tiny starter tag (RNA primer) attached. This unique way of copying its genes helps the virus spread and cause infections.\nIn the case of the Hepatitis B virus, the following steps occur:\n\nrcDNA goes into the cell’s nucleus and turns into a closed circle with the help of the cell’s own tools.\nThe circle of DNA then gets turned into a type of “note” called subgenomic RNA by another tool in the cell.\nThis special “note” helps make important parts of the virus, like its protective shell.\nThere’s a special “note” in there called pregenomic RNA (i.e., pgRNA), which has all the virus’s instructions.\nThe pgRNA gets wrapped up with a protein coat called capsid and another tool from the virus.\nA part of the pgRNA gets turned around, almost like a mirror image, to create a different kind of DNA.\nWhile doing this, the tool from the virus breaks down some parts of the pgRNA to help with the process.\nThe tool uses a tiny piece of the pgRNA as a starting point to create a new piece of DNA that’s important for the virus’s plan.\n\n\n\n\n\n3.1.2 RNA Viruses\n\n\n\n\n\nVisualizations of RNA Viruses\n\n\n\n\nViruses are like little code carriers, and some have instructions made of a special material called RNA. Unlike our own cells, which usually use DNA, these viruses are unique with their RNA instructions. This means that the cell’s copying tools, called polymerases, can’t directly copy these RNA instructions.\nWhen these RNA viruses want to make more of themselves, they have their own tricks. Some use something called an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RDRP) to copy their RNA instructions. It’s like a super-fast copier that can work with RNA. In some cases, like with HIV-1, the virus even has a special tool called RNA-dependent DNA polymerase that helps convert the RNA instructions into DNA.\nThese RNA viruses can have two types of polarity, which is like the direction in which they read their instructions. They can read their instructions in a positive direction (+ve polarity) or in a negative direction (-ve polarity).\nNow, here’s something interesting about -ve stranded viruses. Their RNA instructions are wrapped up in a special package called a nucleocapsid. It’s like their instructions are tucked away in a protective case, keeping them safe while the virus works on copying and spreading.\n\n3.1.2.1 Replication Sites\nWhen RNA viruses want to make more of themselves, most of them do it right in the cell’s playground, called the cytoplasm. But there are a few exceptions, like the influenza virus and HIV-1, which prefer a different spot.\nWhere the virus chooses to replicate, whether in the cytoplasm or somewhere else, actually matters a lot. Think of it like this: certain tasks are easier in certain places. For example, just like how we might have a special room for studying, cells have different rooms for different jobs. The place where a virus copies itself can affect how it does it. For instance, in the cell’s nucleus, a process called gene splicing happens. It’s like putting together different parts of instructions in a certain way. Influenza virus uses this process.\nNow, here’s something cool. Some viruses that usually work in the cell’s playground, the cytoplasm, have developed their own special way of doing things. They’ve found a trick to create gene products that look like they’ve been spliced, even though they didn’t use the cell’s usual room for that. One example of this is RSV.\nSo, where a virus chooses to make more of itself affects how it does it, and some viruses even have clever strategies to get their work done in their favorite spots.\n\n\n3.1.2.2 Replication Stratagies\n\n3.1.2.2.1 Positive Stranded RNA Viruses\n\n\n\n\n\nRNA Replication in Positive Sense RNA Viruses\n\n\n\n\nPositive-stranded RNA viruses have a nifty way of getting things done. They use their instructions directly to make stuff. It’s like reading a recipe and instantly cooking up a dish.\nJust like how a recipe can be shared and someone else can make the same dish, these viruses can spread by sharing their “recipe” too. If you take the genetic instructions from these viruses and put them in a new cell, it can start making more viruses just by reading those instructions.\nThe main set of instructions in these viruses is a special kind of RNA, and this RNA gets turned into a whole bunch of different parts that the virus needs, both the important structural pieces and the things that help it copy itself.\nSo, in simple terms, these positive-stranded RNA viruses have a unique method where their instructions are like instant blueprints for making all the tools and parts they need. And these instructions can even be shared to make new viruses.\n\n3.1.2.2.1.1 Further Notes\nSome viruses, like dengue, have a straightforward way of doing things. They don’t bother with making special notes, and instead, they put all their important instructions in one place. It’s like having a single recipe that includes everything they need to make.\nBut then there are other viruses, such as norovirus, that work a bit differently. They’re like chefs who have a master plan. First, they create a base mixture that will later help them make important tools (proteins). This special mixture is a bit like a dough that’s used for various things.\nOnce this mixture is ready, another tool in the virus starts working like a chef’s hands. It takes parts of the mixture and shapes them into different types of tools, just like a baker making different types of cookies from the same dough.\n\n\n\n3.1.2.2.2 Negative Stranded RNA Viruses\nSome viruses, known as negative-stranded RNA viruses, have a unique trait. The genetic information they carry isn’t directly able to start an infection. It’s like having a puzzle piece that doesn’t fit until you add something extra.\n\n\n\n\n\nNegative-Sense RNA Viruses\n\n\n\n\nThese viruses, however, come prepared. When they enter a cell, they bring along a special helper called a polymerase. This helper is like a construction worker who carries the tools needed to build something.\nFor these viruses, the first step to making more copies of themselves involves making a copy of their genetic material, but in the opposite direction. It’s like making a mirror image of a picture. This new copy then becomes the template to create more of the original genetic material.\nThis newly created copy now acts as a guidebook. It’s used to produce special messages called mRNA, which tell the cell how to build parts of the virus.\nSo, in a nutshell, these negative-stranded RNA viruses can’t start an infection right away with their genetic material. They bring a helper along, copy their genetic info in a special way, and use that copy to create important messages to build their virus parts.\n\n\n\n3.1.2.3 Ambisense RNA Viruses\n\n\n\n\n\nAmbisense RNA Viruses\n\n\n\n\nImagine some viruses are like two-sided books. One side has a positive story, and the other side has a negative story. These viruses, called ambisense RNA viruses, are a bit like that.\nIn these viruses, the genetic material is set up in a special way. It’s like having a book where one end has a sad story (negative) and the other end has a happy story (positive).\nWhen these viruses want to do their thing, they don’t just read the stories. They take the negative side and use it to make a messenger, like a note with important instructions. This note helps make a part of the virus.\nBut then, they also use the positive side to make something else. This time, it’s like they’re using it to make a special kind of worker. This worker helps create a copy of the negative side, kind of like making more copies of the sad story.\nThese new copies are like templates, and they’re used to make more workers and more important notes. So, these ambisense viruses do things in a special way, using both sides of their “book” to create different parts of themselves.\n\n\n3.1.2.4 Double-Stranded RNA Viruses\n\n\n\n\n\nDouble-Stranded RNA Viruses\n\n\n\n\nThink of some viruses like a book with two sides. One side is the “main story” (genomic RNA), but it’s locked away in a special case that’s not infectious by itself.\nWhen these viruses want to do their thing, they open the case and make copies of one side of the story (making +ve single stranded RNA). These copies are like summarized versions of the main story.\nThen, these copies are turned into workers (proteins) that join together and form a team (subviral particles). Imagine each worker has a special job, and when they work together, they create something new.\nInterestingly, these workers also play a role in making new cases. They include the summarized copies (i.e., ssRNA) inside these new cases. These cases, in turn, help create more of the main story (genomic RNA) by using the summarized versions as templates.\nSo, these double-stranded RNA viruses work like bookkeepers, using copies of one side of the story to create teams and new cases that eventually help make more complete stories.\n\n\n\n3.1.3 Quasispecies\n\n\n\n\n\nVisualizations of Quasispecies\n\n\n\n\nThe way viruses copy their instructions isn’t always perfect. Some viruses, like those with RNA instructions, don’t have a good proofreading system in place, except for some like CoV. This means they sometimes make mistakes when copying.\nThese copying mistakes make these viruses a bit like a big family with lots of cousins. They have a bunch of similar sequences, but they’re not exactly the same. This is called a quasispecies, where a virus family has different related members in one big group.\nImagine this: when these viruses copy themselves, they might make around 1 mistake in every 10,000 letters. That’s like writing a really long story and making a couple of typos.\nThe number of these viruses in a group can be huge, like having 100 million influenza virus particles in a tiny drop of liquid.\nBecause of these mistakes and the large number of viruses, you end up with lots of closely related but slightly different viruses in the family. This mix of similar but not identical viruses is what we call a quasispecies.\nThink of it like this: in a big group of friends, everyone is different in their own way, but they still belong to the same group. These virus families have their own versions too, but they’re all part of the same viral family. Some versions might be better at certain things, like surviving in different environments or against drugs or antibodies.\n\n\n3.1.4 Retroviruses\n\n\n\n\n\nIllustration of Retroviruses\n\n\n\n\nImagine retroviruses like treasure hunters. They carry a special tool called reverse transcriptase (i.e., RT) that helps them convert their single-stranded RNA into double-stranded DNA. It’s like turning a one-sided note into a two-sided page.\nWhen these retroviruses enter a cell, they bring this tool with them. It’s kind of like they have a helper in their backpack.\nThen, this double-stranded DNA finds a cozy spot to settle down in the cell’s own bookshelf, which is like the host genome. It’s like placing a piece of paper into a big book.\nThis settled DNA is called a provirus. Think of it as a bookmark that’s stuck in the book forever.\nThe cell’s own tools, like its “RNA polymerase,” read this bookmark and create something new based on the instructions. It’s like the cell taking inspiration from the bookmark and writing a new story."

It’s like they easily understand the cell’s machines for reading instructions. Their instructions are built to fit these machines, like they have a special key that works perfectly. Imagine it’s like putting together a puzzle, where all the pieces match.\nFor negative-strand viruses, these are a bit different. They’re like the “mysterious” viruses. They don’t focus on using the cell’s tools to make stuff. Instead, they have their own tools, like a special writer, to create new things. So, their instructions are like their own secret code, and they don’t necessarily fit the cell’s machines like the positive-strand viruses do.\n\n3.2.1 Baltimore Virus Classification\n\n\n\n\n\nDiagram Illustrating the Baltimore Classification System for Viruses\n\n\n\n\nThe system has seven groups:\n\nDouble-stranded DNA viruses\nThey’re like masters of making copies of themselves, and they include viruses like poxviruses.\nSingle-stranded DNA viruses\nThese are like “positive” thinkers. They use their own instructions to create things, like parvoviruses do.\nDouble-stranded RNA viruses\nThey have a different way of copying themselves, like reoviruses.\nPositive single-stranded RNA viruses\nThese are like the “happy storytellers.” They read their instructions directly and make lots of things, just like picornaviruses do.\nNegative single-stranded RNA viruses\nThese viruses have their own mysterious code. They don’t match the cell’s instructions exactly, and they include viruses like orthomyxoviruses.\nRNA-RT viruses\nThey’re kind of like the time travelers. They use their RNA instructions to create DNA temporarily, and this DNA helps them make more copies of themselves. Retroviruses, like HIV-1, belong to this group.\nDNA-RT viruses\nThese are like the “retro” writers. They use their DNA to make a special type of DNA with a twist, and hepadnaviruses are an example."

This results in a double-sided RNA, which is a signal for the cell’s defense system, like a guard alert.\nTo avoid causing too much trouble for the cell, RNA viruses need to control how much they make. Imagine it’s like not making too much noise in someone else’s house.\nWhen positive-strand viruses copy their RNA, they can create both the tools they need (proteins) and new instruction manuals (virus genomes). This means they don’t make too many opposite-sided copies (negative strands), only a small amount.\nFor negative-strand viruses, it’s a bit different. They need lots of both sides of their instructions to function well, like having both pages of a book to read. These instructions are always wrapped up with a protective cover, so the two sides don’t stick together and cause problems."

Imagine if you had a book where the first page had instructions for making five different things, like a robot, a cake, and a car. This is like how a virus’s instructions are set up.\nThe virus’s tools for making things sometimes struggle to read these mixed-up instructions and start making things at the right spots. It’s like having trouble starting to build the robot before making the cake.\n\n3.5.1 Processing at Genetic Level\nImagine these viruses having a big recipe book. But instead of separate recipes for each dish, they have one big recipe that can make many dishes. This big recipe is like a “polyprotein.”\nTo make these dishes, the virus needs some help. It’s like having a chef (protease) from both the virus and the cell’s kitchen. These chefs work together to cut and prepare the different dishes from the big recipe.\nIn some cases, these viruses have a special trick. It’s like having a shortcut in the recipe book, called an “internal ribosome entry site” or IRES. This shortcut helps the virus start cooking from a specific page, even though the recipe is mixed up.\n\n\n3.5.2 On-off Mechanism\nThink of the virus like a reader going through a long storybook. This storybook has different chapters, each talking about something different.\nFor viruses like Paramyxoviruses, they have a cool trick. It’s like having a “magic stop sign” at the end of each chapter. When the reader (viral polymerase) reaches this stop sign, it takes a pause and then moves to the start of the next chapter.\nImagine you’re reading a book, and when you reach the end of a chapter, you automatically move to the start of the next chapter. This is how these viruses create individual messages from their big story (genome).\n\n\n3.5.3 Using Multiple Genomic Segments\n\n\n\n\n\nMultiple Genomic Segments\n\n\n\n\nImagine a puzzle, but instead of one big piece, it’s made up of smaller pieces. Some viruses, like influenza, work like this puzzle.\nInstead of putting all the instructions for making the virus in one place, these viruses spread them out. It’s like having different pieces of a recipe in different places.\nEach piece of the puzzle, or each recipe piece, is responsible for making a different part of the virus.\nBut there’s a challenge.

Though, in some cases, the virus particles are released in a way that causes the cells to burst in a process called lysis - the poliovirus does this.\n\n4.2.1.1 Example: Adenovirus in the Nucleus\n\n\n\n\n\nAssembly of an Adenovirus\n\n\n\n\nAfter the virus uses the host cell’s ribosomes to perform protein synthesis, the proteins need to go back into the nucleus.\nAmong one of many proteins that need to go back to the nucleus is called CA - this depends on another protein called the polypeptide VI protein (i.e., pVI). pVI contains a nuclear localization signal (i.e., NLS) - this is like a passport that allows the protein to gain entry into the cell.\nInside the nucleus, the virus’ capsid forms and the virus’ DNA is put into them. These capsids then get treated by proteases to go from young to mature.\nThe viruses cause the cell to undergo lysis.\n\n\n\n4.2.2 Enveloped Viruses\nThese viruses must get a lipid bilayer (i.e., a layer of fatty acids) when they assemble, and this process can happen anywhere depending on where the virus first assembled.\nThis lipid bilayer also protects the virus from being degraded by the environment.\n\n4.2.2.1 Example: HSV in the Nucleus\n\n\n\n\n\nAssembly of a HSV\n\n\n\n\nThere are four main steps:\n\nThe virus’ capsid forms in the nucleus in a very complicated way.\nThis capsid then goes through the nuclear membrane - this requires two things: a phosphoprotein and a transmembrane protein\nThis capsid is first engulfed by the inner nuclear membrane before it leaves through the outer nuclear membrane.\nThis capsid then gets uptaken by the Golgi membrane.\n\n\n\n\n4.2.3 How Does the Flu Virus Assemble?\n\n\n\n\n\nAssembly of the Influenza Virus\n\n\n\n\nThe influenza virus is different from other RNA viruses as its ribonucleoproteins (i.e., RNPs) need to go from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. This moving is aided by the M and NEP proteins.\nHowever, only the NEP proteins have a nuclear export signal (i.e., NES) that allows it to leave the nucleus. This NES overcomes the NLS that the NP and P proteins have.\nThis NES then goes on to bind to another protein called exportin 1 (i.e., CRM1) - this helps the RNP go into the cytoplasm.\n\n\n4.2.4 Virus Assembly at the Membranes\n\n\n\n\n\nVirus Assembly at the Cellular Membranes\n\n\n\n\nWhen viruses assemble on the cell’s membranes, something known as endosomal sorting complexes (i.e., ESCRT) are needed. These ESCRT complexes help shape the cell’s membrane in a way that allows it to bud away from the cytoplasm.\n\n\n\n\n\nDifferent Membrane Budding Sites\n\n\n\n\nThe above figure shows various locations that a virus can bud from:\n\nThrough the plasma membrane - viruses like the RSV or the influenza virus do this. Secretory vesicles that contain the virus can also be made.\nThrough the internal membranes, like the ER (e.g., the rotavirus), the Golgi apparatus (e.g., the Hataan virus), or the nuclear membranes (e.g., the HSV-1 virus).\n\nIf the virus leaves from the internal membranes, then mature viruses can only be released. In many cases, the glycoproteins that the virus has can influence where budding happens.\n\n\n4.2.5 Modifications of Viral Proteins\nThere are a few ways that viral proteins can be modified - especially during budding:\n\nGlycosylation\n\n\n\n\n\nDifferent Glycosylation Outcomes\n\n\n\n\nWhen glycosylation doesn’t happen, this can interfere with the activity of some viral fusion protein - like the RSV’s F protein. Though, glycosylation can also affect how proteases cleave the influenza virus’ HA protein.\nAttaching Lipids to Viral Proteins\n\n\n\n\n\nAttachment of Palmitoyl Groups to Cysteine Residues\n\n\n\n\nWhen something called palmitoyl is attached to the amino acid cysteine, scientist think that this may help stabilize viral fusion proteins. This typically happens on the carbon terminus of the cysteine residue - this happens on the cytoplasm side of the protein.\nMyristylation - on the other hand - refers to adding something called myristic acid to the nitrogen end of glycine.\nProteolytic Cleavage\nThe reality is that many viral fusion proteins need to be activated by proteases (i.e., proteins that promote degradtion) so that they can perform their functions.\n\n\n\n\n\nEbola Virus’ G Protein Being Cleaved by Furin\n\n\n\n\nA protease called furin and proteases similar to furin can be found in the Golgi apparatus. Furin is found in many cell types and has multiple cleavage sites.\nThere are also cell-specific proteases like the Clara protease. These proteases are typically specific to tissues and only work on single to double amino acids."

There’s something called the raft hypothesis that states that certain areas (i.e., microdomains) of the cell membrane have more types of a specific kind of lipid.\n\n4.3.2.1 Why do Lipid Rafts Form?\nDifferent kinds of lipids in the membranes of an animal’s cell don’t all provide the same stability.\nThat said, virus assembly can occur in these lipid raft microdomains. Many kinds of viruses - including the HIV and influenza virus - tend to use lipid rafts as a way of releasing themselves."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Antivirus drugs are essential tools in the fight against infectious diseases. They serve two main purposes: managing outbreaks and treating or preventing virus infections.\nIn the first scenario, antivirus drugs are used to manage outbreaks, especially during pandemics. Let’s take the example of the influenza virus pandemic. These drugs are administered to key individuals, such as healthcare workers, to control the spread of the virus until vaccines become available. Essentially, antivirus drugs help keep the situation under control when we’re waiting for vaccines to be ready.\nIn the second scenario, antivirus drugs are used to treat or prevent virus infections when vaccines are not effective or appropriate. For instance, some viruses like HIV-1 can be tricky to develop effective vaccines for, and some patients with HIV-1 are immunocompromised. In such cases, antivirus drugs are crucial in managing the infection. Additionally, there are viruses like RSV and HIV for which vaccines are not available, making antivirus drugs the primary line of defense in these situations. These drugs are a vital tool in protecting individuals from these viruses when no vaccine is at hand.\nFirstly, scientists can target each step in the virus life cycle. Viruses have a specific sequence of events they follow when infecting a host, and we can develop treatments that disrupt these steps. This disrupts the virus’s ability to replicate and spread.\nSecondly, there’s a complex relationship between the virus and the host organism it infects. This connection is intricate and plays a significant role in how a virus operates. By studying this relationship, researchers can find weaknesses they can exploit to combat the virus effectively.\nHowever, there’s a challenge in developing treatments - selectivity and toxicity. While we want treatments to target the virus, we also want to avoid harming the host organism. Striking the right balance between being selective against the virus and avoiding toxicity to the host can be a tricky task.\nTo tackle these challenges, we need a deeper understanding of how viruses interact with their host. The more we know about these interactions, the better equipped we are to develop treatments that specifically target the virus while minimizing harm to the host. In essence, gaining greater insights into virus-host interactions is critical for improving the way we combat viral infections."

    "section": "5.1 General Considerations Behind Virus Drug Development",
    "text": "5.1 General Considerations Behind Virus Drug Development\nThere are some general considerations when it comes to antivirus drugs:\nFirstly, each virus has its own set of specific proteins. This means that antivirus drugs need to be specifically designed to target the particular virus they’re meant to combat. They can’t be one-size-fits-all.\nSecondly, some viruses can go into a latent or dormant state within the body. In these cases, antivirus drugs might not completely cure the infection, but they can help manage the symptoms and reduce the virus’s activity.\nIt’s also important to note that early treatment is often crucial for the effectiveness of antivirus drugs. For example, drugs like Tamiflu work best when administered early in the course of an infection.\nHowever, there can be challenges related to the pharmaceutical industry, particularly in terms of drug development. Developing drugs, especially for diseases like Ebola, can be expensive. The potential market for these drugs might not be as large, which can deter pharmaceutical companies from investing in research and development.\nCost is a significant issue, especially in developing countries. While some antivirus drugs, like the human monoclonal antibody against RSV (Respiratory Syncytial Virus), can be highly effective, their expense makes them less accessible in regions with limited resources. So, finding ways to make these drugs more affordable is a critical concern, as everyone should have access to effective treatments regardless of their location or financial means.\n\n5.1.1 Strategies for Antivirus Drugs\nNote that all three strategies shown here can all be used with one another.\n\n5.1.1.1 Testing Specific Drugs\nFirstly, scientists test specific drugs to see if they can stop or inhibit the replication of a virus. For instance, a drug like amantadine may be examined for its antiviral properties.\nIt’s worth noting that the discovery of these antiviral activities is often serendipitous, meaning that researchers sometimes stumble upon these properties while studying a drug for another purpose.\nOnce a drug shows promise, further evaluation is necessary. This involves understanding the mechanism of action, which is how the drug works against the virus. This knowledge is crucial for optimizing its effectiveness.\nA significant concern in the development and use of antivirus drugs is the potential for drug resistance to develop. Viruses can adapt and become less susceptible to the effects of a drug, reducing its efficacy over time. This is an ongoing challenge in the field of antiviral drug development.\nFinally, there’s the concept of drug repurposing. This means taking existing drugs that were originally designed for a different purpose and discovering that they have antiviral properties. This approach can save time and resources compared to developing entirely new drugs from scratch.\n\n\n5.1.1.2 Rational Approaches\nIn the world of antiviral drug development, there are two main approaches: the rational approach and the cell-based approach. Let’s break down what these mean.\nThe rational approach is like a detective work where scientists search for clues to create drugs that can fight viruses. They use a method called high-throughput screening to identify specific parts of the virus that they can target. Imagine it like finding the weak spots of a villain. In this case, they look for a viral gene product, which is a tiny piece of the virus. To create a drug, they often need to purify a protein or a group of proteins. These drugs work by blocking the bad things the virus proteins do. They even have fancy machines, like robots, to help them quickly test lots of drugs. For example, they found drugs like nevirapine to fight HIV1.\nOn the other hand, the cell-based approach is a bit different. It’s like a big experiment where scientists use whole cells to test drugs. This approach is usually slower and can be a bit tricky and costly. However, it lets scientists explore many different parts of the virus at once. They even have special machines that can do this, like robotic systems with viruses that light up, sort of like a virus disco. With this approach, they found drugs like PA-457 to fight HIV by stopping the virus from growing up.\n\n\n5.1.1.3 Structure-Based Approaches\nIn the world of creating antivirus drugs, there’s a cool approach called the structure-based approach. It’s like having a superpower that lets scientists see the virus in 3D, just like in a video game. Let’s break down what that means.\nWith this approach, scientists can figure out the three-dimensional (3D) shape of the virus’s proteins. It’s kind of like having a detailed map of the virus. This map allows scientists to zoom in and see the tiny, important parts of the virus proteins super up close, like using a microscope that shows things at the atomic level.\nNow, with this powerful 3D map, scientists can understand how the virus works on a biochemical level. It’s like knowing the secret moves of a video game character. They can use this knowledge to design medicines that can stop the virus in its tracks. One example is a medicine called Zanamivir, which fights the flu virus by targeting a part of the virus called neuraminidase.\nSo, the structure-based approach is like having a superhero vision that lets scientists see the virus in 3D. This helps them design smart medicines that can defeat the virus, just like a hero taking down a villain in a video game.\n\n\n\n5.1.2 Developing Hits\nIn the quest to find antiviral drugs, scientists use different methods to discover a promising candidate, which they call a hit. These “hits” are substances that show some level of effectiveness in fighting a virus. However, just finding a “hit” isn’t enough. Scientists need to turn this “hit” into a powerful drug with high potency and qualities that make it safe and easy to use, like taking it as a pill or making sure it doesn’t have harmful effects in the body.\nThe properties of an antiviral drug can influence how it’s used in patients. For example, think of medicines like Tamiflu, which you can take as a pill, or Zanamivir, which comes as an aerosol spray, or Peramivir, which is given through an IV. These differences matter because they affect how patients receive the treatment.\nOther important things to consider are the market and patents. The availability of a drug, along with its patents (like exclusive rights to make and sell it), can impact its use and availability.\nOnce a “hit” is found and turned into a good drug with the right qualities, it’s ready for clinical trials. These are like big tests to see if the drug works well and is safe for patients. But there’s always a concern about the drug’s toxicity, meaning how harmful it might be. Many antiviral drugs can have side effects, which are like unwanted consequences. Scientists need to find a balance between the benefits of the drug and any costs, like the nausea that amantadine can cause versus the protection it offers against H5N1 infection."

    "text": "5.2 Drug Actions\n\n5.2.1 Virus Attachment and Entry\n\n\n\n\n\nAttachment of a Virus to Gain Entry into a Cell\n\n\n\n\nDrugs can help target viruses’ entries into the cell (to cause an infection). This is a mechanism that is targeted by many treatments (e.g., Zanamivir).\n\n5.2.1.1 Fusion Inhibitors\n\n\n\n\n\nExample of a Fusion Inhibitor at Play\n\n\n\n\nLet’s dive into the fascinating world of fusion inhibitors, with a specific example called Enfurirtide, or T20 for short. These inhibitors are like the bouncers at the door of a club, stopping viruses from getting in.\nScientists discovered fusion inhibitors, like T20, when they were testing tiny pieces called peptides to see if they could stop the HIV1 virus from infecting cells in a lab dish.\nHere’s the trick: when HIV1 tries to sneak into a cell, it has to bind with something called gp120, like a key fitting into a lock. This connection sets off a change in shape, a bit like a transformer turning into a different form. This change lets two parts, HR1 and HR2, start interacting. It’s this interaction that helps the virus fuse with the cell’s membrane.\nNow, T20 comes in and plays the hero. It binds to HR1 on a different part called gp41 and says, “No way, you’re not coming in!” By blocking this interaction between HR1 and HR2, T20 prevents the virus from joining forces with the cell. Essentially, it stops the virus from fusing with the cell’s outer covering, like a locked door.\n\n\n5.2.1.2 Cell Surface Receptors\n\n\n\n\n\nMaraviroc Mechanism\n\n\n\n\nLet’s talk about CCR5 and its role in HIV1 infection. CCR5 is like a key that the HIV1 virus needs to enter some types of human cells. Maraviroc is a kind of drug that prohibits HIV1 from getting into a cell by binding to the CCR5 primary receptor (though the virus can also get in using the CXCR4 receptor - this drug needs to be checked for its effectiveness).\n\n\n\n\n\nEntry of the HIV1 Virus into a Cell\n\n\n\n\nScientists figured out that CCR5 is crucial for the virus to get a foothold in the body. They used animal models, which are sort of like test subjects in the lab, to show that CCR5 is essential for the virus to start an infection.\nBut guess what? Scientists found a way to block CCR5 and stop the virus in its tracks. They used something natural called RANTES, which is like a superhero protein that can lock CCR5 and keep it from letting HIV1 in. This is a bit like changing the lock on a door so that the old key doesn’t work.\nThere are other things like TAK-779 that also block CCR5 by preventing RANTES from binding to it. They’re like additional locks on the door.\nAnd then there’s PRO 140, which is like a special antibody created to fight against CCR5. The great thing about PRO 140 is that it doesn’t lead to multi-drug resistance (which is when the virus gets smarter and figures out how to get in) or direct toxic effects in the body. It’s a friendly defender against the virus.\n\n\n\n5.2.2 Uncoating\n\n\n\n\n\nAmantadine Mechanism in Preventing Influenza Virus Uncoating\n\n\n\n\nLet’s explore what happens after a virus attaches to and enters a cell. After this sneak attack, some viruses need to uncoat themselves to release their genetic material, which is like the virus’s secret code. This uncoating step is crucial for the virus to take control of the cell.\nBut, here’s where our heroes, drugs like Amantadine and Rimantadine (Symmetrel and Flumadine, respectively), come into play. These drugs are like the bouncers at a club, preventing the virus from getting into the party.\nAmantadine and Rimantadine target a specific part called the M2 ion channel. Think of it like the virus’s entry gate. The M2 protein is responsible for forming a tiny channel that’s picky about the protons (charged particles) it lets in.\nNow, here’s the clever part: Amantadine binds to certain sequences within the M2 protein’s channel, specifically in its transmembrane region. It’s like putting a plug in the drain to stop water from flowing. Scientists discovered this by studying the virus’s resistance to the drug, which is like figuring out how to get past a locked door.\n\n5.2.2.1 How Does Amantadine Work?\n\n\n\n\n\nAmantaine’s Mechanism\n\n\n\n\nLet’s continue our exploration of Amantadine’s superhero powers in the fight against viruses. Now, we’ll look at how it works at a molecular level.\nRemember how we talked about the M2 protein forming a channel for protons (charged particles)? Well, this channel leads to an increase in the acid levels inside the virus, and that’s like the alarm going off. This acidity causes the virus’s genetic material (the RNP) to separate from another important part called M1.\nHere’s where Amantadine steps in as the hero. It blocks the proton channel’s activity, like shutting off the alarm system. By doing this, it prevents the increase in acidity. As a result, the RNP and M1 can’t detach from each other, which is a crucial part of the uncoating process. In simpler terms, Amantadine stops the virus from unpacking its secret code.\nBut, viruses can be clever too. They sometimes develop resistance to Amantadine. This happens when the virus mutates, which means its genetic makeup changes. In this case, it’s a mutation in the transmembrane domain (a part of the M2 protein) that forms the pore. This mutation prevents Amantadine from binding to the M2 protein and blocking its activity. One example of this resistant mutation is called S31N.\nSo, Amantadine is like the guardian of the virus’s uncoating process, blocking the proton channel and keeping the virus’s genetic material under wraps. However, the virus can sometimes outsmart Amantadine by changing its genetic code. This constant battle between viruses and drugs keeps scientists on their toes in the fight against infections.\n\n\n\n5.2.3 Genome Replication\n\n5.2.3.1 Nucleoside Inhibitors\nLet’s explore how nucleoside inhibitors work in the battle against viruses. These inhibitors are like undercover agents trying to confuse the virus’s genetic machinery.\nNucleoside inhibitors mimic something called nucleoside monophosphates. Think of them as sneaky impostors that pretend to be part of the virus’s genetic code. But there’s a catch – they need to be activated first. To activate them, they go through a process called phosphorylation, which is like putting on their disguise.\nOnce these inhibitors are activated, they compete with the virus’s natural building blocks called dNTPs. It’s like a race, and the inhibitors want to win. They block the dNTPs from joining the growing viral genetic material.\nAs a result, the viral DNA chain, which is like a long, spiraling ladder, gets stuck. The inhibitors act like a roadblock and stop the ladder from growing. This termination of elongation prevents the virus from making more copies of itself, which is a big win in the fight against infections.\n\n5.2.3.1.1 Acyclovir\n\n\n\n\n\nAcyclovir Mode of Action\n\n\n\n\nLet’s dive into the world of antiviral drugs, specifically how a drug called ACV (acyclovir) works against herpes viruses like HSV. ACV is like a secret agent with a unique mission.\nACV has a part that’s like a guanine base, which is a building block for the virus’s genetic material, attached to a sugar-like molecule. It’s this special structure that makes ACV effective against herpes viruses.\nIn the world of herpes, there’s a key player called thymidine kinase, or TK for short. TK is involved in making the virus’s DNA. When ACV enters an HSV-infected cell, TK recognizes it and does something called phosphorylation. This is like giving ACV a secret code that activates its power.\nHere’s the clever part: while both HSV-infected and non-infected cells have TK, only the TK in HSV-infected cells can efficiently give ACV that secret code. As a result, HSV-infected cells have about 100 times more phosphorylated ACV than non-infected cells.\nThis is where the magic of selectivity comes in. The drug ACV targets the virus specifically because only in infected cells does it get that secret code. It’s like a lock and key that fits perfectly in the virus but not in healthy cells.\nSo, ACV is like a smart secret agent that can infiltrate the virus’s world with a special key, thanks to the unique abilities of TK. This selectivity is the secret to its success in fighting herpes infections.\n\n5.2.3.1.1.1 More on Acyclovir\nLet’s take a closer look at how ACV (acyclovir) puts a stop to the replication of the virus’s genetic material. ACV acts like a roadblock in the virus’s path.\n\n\n\n\n\nACY Complex Inhibiting Herpes Virus Replication\n\n\n\n\nFirst, ACV needs to undergo a series of transformations. It starts as ACV and gets phosphorylated by a cellular enzyme called thymidine kinase, turning into ACV-monophosphate (ACV-MP). Then, another enzyme, called guanosine monophosphate kinase, adds a phosphate group, transforming it into ACV-diphosphate (ACV-DP). Afterward, more cellular enzymes chip in to make it into ACV-triphosphate (ACV-TP). This transformation process is like getting the right outfit and gear for a special mission.\nNow, ACV-TP is ready to do its job. It acts like a double agent, pretending to be a building block for the virus’s genetic material. When the virus is replicating its DNA, it needs certain building blocks, one of which is dGTP. ACV-TP steps in and competes with dGTP for a spot in the growing DNA chain.\nThe virus’s DNA polymerase, the worker responsible for building the DNA, grabs ACV-TP instead of dGTP. It starts to add ACV-TP to the DNA chain. But here’s the clever part: the moment ACV-TP is in place, the DNA polymerase can’t move forward. That’s because there’s no 3’OH (a chemical group) on ACV-TP, which is needed for the DNA-building process to continue.\nThis interruption in the DNA chain elongation is like a roadblock on the virus’s path. It stops the virus from making more copies of itself and helps put an end to the infection.\n\n\n\n5.2.3.1.2 Nucleoside Analogues\n\n\n\n\n\nExamples of Nucleotide Analogues\n\n\n\n\nNow, let’s explore some exciting developments in antiviral drugs inspired by ACV (acyclovir). These drugs aim to enhance certain aspects of ACV’s effectiveness.\nOne of these new drugs is Valacyclovir, which is like an upgraded version of ACV. Valacyclovir is better absorbed by the body compared to ACV, meaning it gets to work more efficiently. This improved absorption is referred to as “bioavailability.” It’s like making a medicine that’s not only strong but also gets to the right places in the body faster, like a speedier messenger on a mission.\nAnother pair of drugs, Ganciclovir and Valganciclovir, have shown promise in fighting the Human Cytomegalovirus (HCMV). This is interesting because ACV isn’t very effective against HCMV. Ganciclovir and Valganciclovir are like new recruits in the battle against HCMV. They target a different part of the virus called UL97, which ACV doesn’t tackle well.\nThese developments are like adding new weapons to the arsenal against viral infections. Valacyclovir ensures that the medicine is absorbed better, while Ganciclovir and Valganciclovir offer a more effective strategy against a virus that ACV struggles to combat. It’s all about fine-tuning our approach to fight different viruses with the right tools.\n\n\n5.2.3.1.3 Zidovudine (AZT)\n\n\n\n\n\nStructure of Zidovudine\n\n\n\n\nHIV, the virus responsible for AIDS, has a sneaky trick up its sleeve. It carries its genetic information in the form of RNA, but it needs to convert this RNA into DNA to take control of human cells. This conversion is like turning a script into a movie, and it’s made possible by a special enzyme called HIV reverse transcriptase (RT).\nHere’s the interesting part: HIV RT is different from the cellular polymerases found in our body, which are like the workers that build and repair our genetic material. This uniqueness makes HIV RT an excellent target for drugs, like a weak point in the virus’s armor.\nOne such drug is Zidovudine (also known as AZT). AZT is a type of drug called a nucleoside analogue. It mimics the building blocks of DNA and RNA. When the virus tries to copy its genetic material, it grabs AZT instead of the real building block. This leads to mistakes in the viral DNA, disrupting its ability to replicate accurately.\nFor patients with HIV, AZT had a significant impact, at least in the short term. It helped reduce the mortality rate among HIV-infected patients, offering a ray of hope in the battle against this challenging virus.\n\n5.2.3.1.3.1 Zidovudine’s Mode of Action\n\n\n\n\n\nMode of Action of Zidovudine\n\n\n\n\nLet’s break down the process of how AZT (zidovudine) works as an antiviral drug, specifically targeting HIV. Think of this as understanding the steps in a crucial battle against the virus.\n\nAZT is initially converted by a cellular enzyme called thymidine kinase (TK) into AZT-monophosphate (AZT-MP). This conversion is like preparing a specialized tool for a specific job.\nAZT-MP is then further modified to AZT-diphosphate (AZT-DP) by another cellular enzyme called thymidylate kinase. It’s like upgrading the tool to be more effective.\nThe final transformation occurs when AZT-DP is converted to AZT-triphosphate (AZT-TP) by a cellular enzyme called nucleoside diphosphate kinase. This is like giving the tool its ultimate form, ready to do its job with full force.\n\nNow, AZT-TP, in its triphosphate form, is a potent substrate for the HIV reverse transcriptase (RT), the enzyme crucial for HIV replication. It’s like a master key that can unlock the virus’s secrets. When AZT-TP is incorporated into the growing viral DNA chain, it acts like a stop sign, terminating the DNA elongation process. This halts the virus’s ability to replicate and spread.\nHowever, there’s a catch. While AZT-TP is effective against HIV, it can accumulate not only in infected cells but also in healthy cells. This accumulation can lead to toxicity, which is like a side effect of the battle. Balancing the benefits of stopping HIV with the potential toxicity is a critical consideration in the use of AZT.\n\n\n\n\n5.2.3.2 Non-Nucleotide Inhibitors\nNucleoside analogue inhibitors, like AZT (zidovudine), can be effective against viruses, but they come with a challenge. They can also inhibit cellular enzymes, which can lead to unwanted side effects. It’s like trying to hit a specific target but accidentally hitting something else in the process.\nTo address this issue, scientists have worked on developing drugs that can inhibit viral polymerases through a different mechanism. One such drug is Foscarnet. This drug is like a secret agent with a unique mission.\n\n\n\n\n\nSite of Activity of Foscaranet\n\n\n\n\nFoscarnet is an analogue of pyrophosphate, a molecule that plays a role in DNA replication. What makes Foscarnet special is that it directly inhibits the viral polymerase by binding to a specific region of the protein that is normally occupied by pyrophosphate. It’s like infiltrating the enemy’s stronghold and disrupting their command center.\nBy doing this, Foscarnet prevents the normal release of pyrophosphate during viral DNA replication. This interference is highly selective, as it targets the viral polymerase while sparing cellular enzymes. It’s like using a precision tool to disarm the enemy without causing harm to innocent bystanders.\nFoscarnet’s unique mechanism of action makes it a valuable weapon against certain viruses. It can even be used to treat infections caused by a virus that has developed resistance to other drugs, such as ACV-resistant CMV (cytomegalovirus).\n\n\n\n\n\nMore Examples of Non-Nucleoside Inhibitors\n\n\n\n\nNon-Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors (NNRTIs), which include medications like efavirenz, nevirapine, and delavirdine. These drugs are like skilled marksmen in the fight against the virus.\nNNRTIs are highly specific, meaning they are designed to precisely target and inhibit a specific enzyme in the HIV virus called reverse transcriptase (RT). The beauty of NNRTIs is that they can accomplish this at very low concentrations without affecting our own cellular DNA polymerase, which is responsible for our own DNA replication. It’s like having a sniper that can pinpoint the enemy without hitting innocent bystanders.\nWhat’s fascinating about NNRTIs is that they directly inhibit HIV’s reverse transcriptase. This enzyme is essential for the virus to convert its RNA genetic material into DNA, a key step in the replication process. By interfering with this process, NNRTIs prevent HIV from making copies of itself, essentially stopping its replication dead in its tracks. It’s like cutting off the virus’s supply lines.\n\n5.2.3.2.1 Site of Action\n\n\n\n\n\nSite of Action of NNRTIs\n\n\n\n\nNNRTIs have a specific target within HIV-1, and that’s a region near the active site of the virus’s reverse transcriptase enzyme. This region is essential for the enzyme’s function, much like the core of a lock. NNRTIs are like a unique key designed to fit this specific lock.\nInterestingly, NNRTIs don’t inhibit the binding of dNTP (nucleotide building blocks) to the enzyme, which is crucial for DNA synthesis. Instead, they slow down the incorporation of dNTP into the newly synthesized DNA molecule. It’s as if they are slowing down the process of adding new pieces to the viral genetic code.\nMoreover, NNRTIs block conformational changes in the polymerase structure, which are essentially shape-shifts that the enzyme undergoes during its function. These shape-shifts are crucial for the enzyme’s activity. By blocking these changes, NNRTIs disrupt the functioning of the enzyme, making it unable to perform its job effectively.\n\n\n\n5.2.3.3 Ribavarin (i.e., Virazole)\n\n\n\n\n\nStructure of Ribavarin\n\n\n\n\nRibavirin is like a secret agent with a clever disguise. Its ribose sugar moiety is attached to a base, making it look like a purine, which is a building block of genetic material. This disguise allows it to interfere with the genetic replication process of many different viruses.\nIn laboratory settings (in vitro) and in living organisms (in vivo), Ribavirin has shown its ability to exhibit antiviral activity. It’s like a vigilant guard that can fend off various intruders.\nWhat’s fascinating is that Ribavirin can be a team player. It can be used in combination with other drugs to enhance its antiviral effects. This cooperative approach is like different warriors joining forces to protect a kingdom.\nRibavirin has received approval for use against specific viruses, such as the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections. It’s like a hero receiving recognition for saving lives.\nTo become effective against viruses, Ribavirin undergoes a transformation within our cells. Cellular adenosine kinase plays a crucial role in converting Ribavirin into Ribavirin-monophosphate. This conversion is like preparing Ribavirin for its antiviral mission.\n\n\n\n\n\nPossible Modes of Action of Ribavarin\n\n\n\n\nThe thing about Ribavarin is that nobody really knows how it works. However, scientists have thought of the following:\n\nOne theory is that Ribavirin inhibits an enzyme called inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase. This action results in a reduction of the pools of guanosine triphosphate (GTP) within the cell. GTP is essential for various cellular processes, and by decreasing its levels, Ribavirin may hinder the virus’s ability to replicate. It’s like cutting off a vital supply line for the virus.\nThere’s another hypothesis suggesting that Ribavirin might inhibit RNA polymerase, an enzyme that plays a key role in viral RNA replication. If true, this inhibition would directly impede the virus’s ability to copy its genetic material, like putting a wrench in the gears of a machine.\nAnother intriguing possibility is that Ribavirin could induce an error catastrophe. This means it might increase the mutation rate of the virus beyond a certain threshold, resulting in a reduced number of functional virus genomes. It’s like introducing chaos into the virus’s genetic code, making it less able to produce effective copies of itself.\nRibavirin might also have immunomodulatory effects. It could impact the signaling pathways related to interferon, a critical component of the immune response. By altering these pathways, Ribavirin might enhance the immune system’s ability to combat the virus. It’s like giving a boost to the body’s defenders.\n\n\n\n\n5.2.4 Assembly and Maturation\nVirus assembly and virus maturation are two separate but closely related processes. It’s like building a complex structure where each step has a unique role, but they are all interconnected.\nWhat makes these processes particularly interesting is that they offer attractive targets for antiviral drugs. These targets exist because of the unique features of the assembly and maturation processes. It’s like identifying vulnerabilities in the enemy’s defenses.\nIn many cases, virus assembly and maturation don’t just result in the formation of new virus particles. They also have a significant impact on cellular processes within the host organism. It’s like the virus’s activities causing ripples throughout the cellular landscape.\nTo develop effective drugs that target virus assembly and maturation, we need a deep understanding of the biology of the specific virus in question. It’s like studying the enemy’s tactics to develop a strategic advantage.\n\n5.2.4.1 HIV Protease Inhibitors\n\n\n\n\n\nStructure of the HIV Protease Inhibitor\n\n\n\n\nThe HIV protease is a key player in the virus’s infectivity. It’s an enzyme that plays a vital role in processing viral proteins, which is essential for HIV to become infectious. Think of it as the virus’s master chef responsible for cutting and preparing the ingredients it needs to replicate.\nThis enzyme is a symmetrical homodimer, meaning it consists of two identical parts. Each part contributes to the enzyme’s active site, where the magic happens. It’s like having two skilled hands working in harmony.\nWhen we look closely at the HIV protease, we see three main features: the active site, flaps, and the dimerization domain. The active site is where the enzyme carries out its precise protein-cutting tasks. The flaps are like security guards that control access to the active site, keeping it secure. The dimerization domain ensures that the two halves of the enzyme work together, creating a powerful and coordinated force.\nHIV protease inhibitors are like puzzle pieces that fit perfectly into the active site, disrupting the enzyme’s function. By blocking this key enzyme, these drugs interfere with the virus’s ability to process its proteins, ultimately inhibiting its replication. It’s like disabling the master chef, making it impossible for the virus to prepare its infectious ingredients.\n\n\n\n\n\nIllustration of the Viral Gag Protein\n\n\n\n\nThe viral gag polypeptide acts as the substrate for the HIV protease. When the virus buds, the protease’s job is to cleave this polyprotein into its constituent proteins. This process is essential for the virus to mature and become infectious. Think of it as the protease being the master chef, meticulously preparing the ingredients for the virus’s replication.\nTo disrupt this crucial step in the virus’s life cycle, many protease inhibitors are designed as peptidomimetic inhibitors. These inhibitors mimic the structure of the natural substrates that the protease would normally cleave. Two examples of such inhibitors are Saquinavir and Ritonavir.\n\n\n\n\n\n3D Structure of an Inhibitor and the Gag Polyprotein\n\n\n\n\nRitonavir, in particular, has an interesting mechanism. It binds to the protease and causes its “flaps” to adopt a closed conformation. These flaps are like the security gates guarding the active site of the enzyme. When they’re closed, the active site is inaccessible, and the protease can’t function properly. It’s like putting a lock on the chef’s kitchen, preventing any further preparation of the virus’s components.\n\n5.2.4.1.1 Drug Resistance\nHIV has a remarkable ability to develop resistance to antiviral drugs, including protease inhibitors. It’s like the virus’s way of adapting and evolving in response to the threat. When the virus is exposed to a particular inhibitor, it can develop specific mutations that allow it to resist the drug’s effects. These mutations can affect the protease enzyme and its interaction with the inhibitor.\nWhat’s intriguing is that different inhibitors tend to select for different resistance mutations. It’s like each inhibitor has its unique “weak points” in the virus’s armor, and the virus adapts accordingly. However, the good news is that resistance to one inhibitor doesn’t necessarily mean resistance to all of them. It’s like the virus’s defenses may work against one type of attack but not another.\n\n\n\n5.2.4.2 Hepatitis C Virus (i.e., HCV) Protease Inhibitors\n\n\n\n\n\nStructure of the HCV Genome\n\n\n\n\nThe HCV genome, like a set of instructions, is translated as a single, long polyprotein. This polyprotein is like a recipe that needs to be prepared to make the virus functional.\nTo help with this process, HCV has a key player called NS3/4A. Think of NS3/4A as a skilled chef in the virus’s kitchen. This enzyme is responsible for processing the polyprotein, breaking it down into its individual components. It’s like chopping and preparing the ingredients to create a delicious dish.\n\n\n\n\n\nExamples of HCV Inhibitors\n\n\n\n\nOne such drug is Simeprevir, which is designed to inhibit the HCV NS3/4A protease. Think of it as a key that fits perfectly into the protease’s lock, preventing it from performing its chopping and processing tasks. By blocking the protease’s function, Simeprevir interrupts the virus’s recipe for replication.\nWhat’s fascinating is that there’s a range of protease inhibitors available, each with its unique way of targeting the NS3-4A protease. It’s like having an assortment of tools to dismantle a complex machine. These inhibitors work by binding to the protease and disrupting its activity.\nBy inhibiting the NS3-4A protease, these drugs hinder the virus’s ability to process its polyprotein, rendering it incomplete and non-infectious. This is a vital step in managing HCV and preventing its spread.\n\n\n\n\n\nRecommendation Therapies for HCV Genotypes\n\n\n\n\nTo effectively combat HCV, specific drugs are often prescribed based on the genotype of the virus.\nFor instance, a drug called Simeprevir is indicated for treating HCV genotypes 1 and 4. It’s like having different keys for different locks, and Simeprevir is the right key for these particular genotypes. To make the treatment even more potent, Simeprevir is used in combination with other medications like pegylated-interferon (alfa) and ribavirin.\nThis tailored approach is crucial because different HCV genotypes may respond differently to treatment. It’s like using the right tool for the job. By matching the appropriate drug to the specific genotype, healthcare providers can maximize the effectiveness of treatment and improve the chances of clearing the virus.\n\n\n\n5.2.5 Egress and Release\n\n\n\n\n\nRelease of the Influenza Virus\n\n\n\n\nThis stage is all about the virus’s exit strategy, ensuring that the newly created virus particles can go on to infect new cells.\nThink of it as the virus’s grand finale, where it makes its grand exit from the host cell. This is a crucial step because it determines the virus’s fate and its ability to continue spreading.\nDuring egress and release, the virus is released from the host cell, often by bursting it open. It’s like a prison break, where the virus escapes to seek out new cells to infect. These newly released virus particles are often referred to as “progeny viruses” because they are the next generation of viruses ready to continue the cycle.\nThe success of this stage is vital for the virus’s survival and its ability to infect new cells. Understanding the mechanisms behind egress and release is essential for developing antiviral strategies that can disrupt this stage, thereby preventing the virus from spreading and causing infection in the host.\n\n5.2.5.1 Neuraminidase Inhibitors\n\n\n\n\n\nNeuraminidase Inhibitors in Play\n\n\n\n\nIn the virus world, sialic acid is like a key that the virus uses to unlock the door to new host cells. During the egress phase, when newly formed virus particles are ready to leave the host cell and infect others, they are associated with their sialic acid receptors. It’s like a virus packing its bags for a journey.\nThis is where neuraminidase (NA) comes into play. Neuraminidase is an enzyme that acts as a pair of scissors, cutting the sialic acid “key” from the surface of the host cell. This cleaving action allows the newly formed virus particles to detach and be released into the surrounding environment.\nBut what happens if there’s no neuraminidase? In this case, the virus particles remain tethered to the cell membrane, like a ship anchored to the dock. They cannot be released, which means they can’t spread to new cells and continue their infectious journey.\nNeuraminidase inhibitors are like locks that prevent these scissors from working. By blocking neuraminidase, these drugs keep the sialic acid “keys” intact, preventing the virus from leaving the host cell. This interruption in the egress process is a powerful strategy for stopping the virus from spreading.\n\n\n\n\n\nStructure of the NA Receptor\n\n\n\n\nUnderstanding the structure of neuraminidase (NA) with a cleaved substrate in its active site was a significant breakthrough. It’s like having a detailed map of a critical part of the virus’s machinery. This knowledge allowed scientists to design something called a sialic acid transition state analogue.\nThink of this analogue as a perfectly crafted key that fits precisely into the lock of the NA’s active site. It occupies the space where the virus’s target, the sialic acid, would normally be. By taking up this space, the transition state analogue effectively blocks the NA’s scissors from cutting the sialic acid.\nThe result is a powerful inhibitor of influenza neuraminidase. These inhibitors work against both influenza A and B, which is fantastic because it broadens their effectiveness. It’s like having a master key that can unlock many doors.\n\n5.2.5.1.1 Zanamivir\nZanamivir was one of the first neuraminidase inhibitors to be developed. It’s like an early superhero in the fight against the flu. However, it has a limitation—it needs to be administered as an aerosol. This means you have to inhale it, which can be a bit cumbersome for some people. It’s like having a powerful weapon, but it’s not always easy to use.\nOn the other hand, we have Oseltamivir (Os), which brought some improvements to the table. This drug has better pharmacokinetic properties, including oral bioavailability. It’s like a superhero with a more versatile suit that can be taken as a pill.\nBut here’s an interesting twist: Oseltamivir is a pro-drug. It means that when you take it, your body needs to do a bit of processing to activate it, transforming it into its active form. Think of it as a superhero costume that needs to be put on before going into action.\nHowever, there’s a challenge: drug resistance. Some viruses can develop a mutation known as H274Y, which makes them resistant to Oseltamivir. This mutation is like a shield that the virus puts up to defend itself.\nBut here’s the good news: the H274Y mutation doesn’t make the virus resistant to Zanamivir. It’s like having two superheroes with different strengths and vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n5.2.5.2 Amantadine and Rimantadine\n\n\n\n\n\nPossible Actions of Amantadine\n\n\n\n\nIn some viruses, like the highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1, there’s an important protein called hemagglutinin (HA). This protein is like the virus’s key to entering host cells. However, for this key to work, it needs to be cut or “cleaved” by certain cellular proteases, like furin.\nNow, here’s where the Golgi apparatus comes into play. Think of it as the virus’s transportation hub. The HA protein is processed and transported through the acidic Golgi apparatus. But there’s a catch—if the cleaved HA undergoes a premature conversion to a fusogenic state, it’s like the key turning too early, and the virus can enter host cells before it’s supposed to.\nEnter the M2 protein. This is another important player in the influenza virus’s game plan. It acts like a pH regulator in the Golgi. It increases the pH in this cellular compartment, kind of like adjusting the acidity level. This increase in pH prevents the premature fusion of the virus’s membrane with the host cell, keeping the virus in check.\nAmantadine, the drug we’re talking about, has an interesting role here. It can also work during these late stages of virus maturation. It’s like a gatekeeper, making sure the M2 protein does its job effectively. By blocking the activity of M2, Amantadine helps maintain the right pH level in the Golgi. This, in turn, prevents the premature fusion of the virus’s membrane, keeping it from entering host cells too soon."

    "section": "5.3 Issues Regarding Antivirals",
    "text": "5.3 Issues Regarding Antivirals\n\n5.3.1 Cost\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAntiviral drugs can be super expensive, and this may be bad news for anybody who needs them, but cannot afford them.\n\n\n5.3.2 Antiviral Drug Resistance\n\n\n\n\n\nIllustration of a Quasispecies\n\n\n\n\nWhen viruses replicate, they don’t always make perfect copies of themselves. It’s like making photocopies of a document with a slightly malfunctioning copier. These imperfect copies lead to a population of related, but not identical, viruses within a single infected individual. This is known as a quasispecies.\nNow, here’s where drug resistance comes into play. Some of these viral variants within the quasispecies might have genetic changes that make them less susceptible to the antiviral drugs we use. It’s like evolution happening at hyper-speed within the virus population. These drug-resistant variants can continue to grow and replicate even when the drug is present, while their drug-sensitive counterparts struggle or die off.\nSo, when we use antiviral drugs, we’re putting pressure on the virus population to evolve. It’s a bit like a selection process. The drugs select for those virus variants that have genetic changes allowing them to survive and replicate in the presence of the drug. Over time, this can lead to the dominance of drug-resistant virus variants.\n\n5.3.2.1 Effect of Speed, Magnitude, and Clinical Impact\nWhen it comes to the development of drug-resistant mutants, the speed, magnitude, and clinical impact can vary significantly. This variation is influenced by several key factors:\n\nMutation Rate: Some viruses naturally have a higher mutation rate than others. For instance, HIV-1 is known for its relatively high mutation rate, leading to a rapid generation of genetic diversity within the virus population.\nReplication Rate: How quickly a virus can replicate within a host also affects the emergence of drug resistance. Faster replication provides more opportunities for genetic mistakes and the evolution of drug-resistant variants.\nVirus Population Size: The size of the virus population in an infected individual matters. More viruses mean a higher chance of some having mutations that confer resistance to drugs.\nVirus Fitness: The fitness of a virus variant, which refers to its ability to replicate and survive in the presence of a drug, is a crucial factor. Drug-resistant variants may have reduced fitness compared to drug-sensitive ones, but this isn’t always the case.\n\nTo illustrate this, let’s consider two examples:\n\n**HIV-1*:** In an HIV-1-infected individual, the virus can generate an astonishing 10 billion virions per day, with approximately one mutation occurring in each generated genome. When drug treatment, such as AZT, is used, it’s often administered for the rest of a person’s life. This extended exposure to the drug creates ample opportunities for drug-resistant mutants to emerge and potentially dominate the viral population.\nHSV (Herpes Simplex Virus): In the case of HSV, the rate of developing resistance to a drug like ACV is relatively low in healthy individuals. This is due to factors such as a smaller virus population, slower virus replication rates, and lower mutation rates. However, in immunocompromised individuals where the virus is not well-controlled by the immune system, ACV resistance can still develop.\n\n\n\n\n5.3.3 Drug Concentration\nAntiviral therapy aims to stop viruses from multiplying inside our bodies. To do that, we use drugs. The goal is to use the right amount of these drugs to completely prevent the virus from making copies of itself. This is important because it helps us get better. However, there’s a problem we need to be careful about. Sometimes, the virus can change and become resistant to the drug. This means the drug doesn’t work anymore.\nThis happens when the drug concentration isn’t just right. If we don’t take the right amount of the drug or if the concentration is too low, it can lead to drug resistance. It’s like not taking your medicine properly. When we don’t use enough of the drug to completely stop the virus, it can start to adapt and become resistant. For example, if someone with the flu takes too little of a drug like Oseltamivir, the flu virus might become resistant to Oseltamivir.\n\n\n5.3.4 Virus Infection Mechanics\n\n\n\n\n\nVirus Infection Mechanics"

They do this by screening or testing the virus. It’s like checking if a lock is working before you use a key. They use a method called targeted PCR to do this. This test helps find any changes in the virus that might make it resistant to the drug.\nThis screening is important for managing chronic infections, like hepatitis B, HIV, or hepatitis C. These infections can last a long time, and using the right drug is crucial. For example, during a big outbreak of the flu, doctors may check if the virus has a specific change called the H274Y mutation in the NA gene.\n\n\n5.4.2 Drug Combinations\nAnother way to tackle viruses is by using a combination of drugs. It’s like having a team of superheroes fighting the bad guys together. This approach is often called combination therapy. One example is highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), used against HIV.\nWhen we use multiple drugs together, it makes it really hard for the virus to become resistant to all of them. It’s like trying to solve a puzzle with multiple pieces missing. The chances of the virus being resistant to all the drugs at the same time are very low. This combination therapy usually does a great job in stopping the virus from multiplying.\nSometimes, the drugs in the combination work even better when used together. It’s like they team up and become stronger, so we can use lower doses, which are less harmful to the body.\nBut there are challenges too. It can be tricky for patients to manage taking multiple drugs regularly. Also, some drugs can have side effects that might make people feel sick. Plus, not all the drugs needed for combination therapy are always available. So, while it’s a powerful strategy, it’s not without its difficulties.\n\n\n5.4.3 Alternative Strategies\n\n\n\n\n\nPotential Host Cell Factors to Target\n\n\n\n\nScientists look for parts in our body that the virus relies on to multiply and cause trouble. These are called druggable host factors. By finding and blocking these factors, we can stop the virus from doing its thing.\nTo use this strategy, we need to really understand how the virus works, like its life cycle and the steps it takes to infect our cells. This helps us figure out which host factors to target.\nSometimes, we can even use existing drugs for other purposes (drug repurposing) to target these host factors. It’s like using a tool for a different job than it was made for. This can be a quicker and cheaper way to find treatments."

    "text": "6.1 Passive and Artificial Immunization\nPassive immunization is a way to help people who can’t make their own antibodies, like those who have weak immune systems. It’s like giving them a temporary shield against diseases.\nImagine you meet a bad guy (the disease) for the first time, and your body doesn’t have the right tools to fight it off. That’s when passive immunization comes to the rescue. It gives you ready-made antibodies that can beat the bad guy. These antibodies are like superheroes in your bloodstream.\nGetting these superhero antibodies can be a bit tricky. It’s expensive and hard to make enough of them because they usually come from lots of donors. Plus, there’s a chance that the antibodies might bring some unwanted stuff (contaminants) with them.\nSometimes, they use antibodies from animals, but that can cause a reaction in the person receiving them, like a “serum sickness.” To avoid this, scientists have come up with humanized antibodies, which are more effective but super expensive.\nHere’s the thing: these antibodies are like short-term superheroes. They help for a while, but they don’t stick around in your body, so they won’t remember the bad guy for next time.\nActive immunization is like superhero training for your body. It’s a way to teach your immune system to fight off bad guys (diseases) without actually getting sick.\nHere’s how it works: you introduce a little piece of the bad guy, called an immunogen, to your body. It’s like showing your immune system a photo of the bad guy so it can recognize them later. This training stimulates your immune system to prepare itself to fight off the real bad guy.\nSo, virus vaccines are like your immune system’s cheat sheets. They help your body practice how to defeat a specific virus without making you sick. These vaccines are the best way to protect yourself from virus infections.\nThe process of giving these vaccines is called vaccination. It’s like your body’s superhero training camp, getting ready to fight off any virus that tries to attack you.\n\n6.1.1 Immune Memory\n\n\n\n\n\nIllustration of Memory of Immune System\n\n\n\n\nThink of vaccines as your immune system’s memory boosters. The amazing thing about our immune system is that it remembers past battles with viruses and knows how to fight them off. Vaccines help create that memory.\nWhen you get a vaccine, it’s like giving your immune system a sneak peek at the enemy. It learns to recognize the bad guy (virus) without you actually getting sick. Your immune system then remembers how to defeat that virus in case it ever shows up for a real fight."

    "section": "6.2 Basics of Vaccines",
    "text": "6.2 Basics of Vaccines\nWhen it comes to vaccines, one of the key things we aim for is to boost the body’s immune response, especially against the parts of viruses that are on their outer surfaces. Think of these parts like the “wanted posters” of the virus world – they help the immune system recognize the villains.\nThe immune system loves to create antibodies against these surface targets. These antibodies act like barriers, making it tough for viruses to infect new cells and spread throughout the body.\nSo, when designing vaccines, we often focus on these surface features, such as the glycoproteins on enveloped viruses (those wrapped in a protective envelope) and the capsid proteins on non-enveloped viruses (those without the envelope). By training the immune system to recognize and attack these surface features, we’re essentially giving it the tools it needs to stop viruses in their tracks. It’s like teaching your body to recognize the “bad guys” and protect you from future attacks!\n\n6.2.1 Interactions Between Antibodies and Virus Surface Antigen\nWhen our immune system encounters viruses, it creates antibodies to fight them off. But these antibodies are quite smart – they mainly recognize the three-dimensional shapes or “conformation” of the viral proteins.\nImagine viral proteins as keys, and the parts our antibodies recognize as unique keyholes. Different parts of the same protein can have multiple keyholes, which are called epitopes.\nAfter an infection, our immune system might make antibodies to just a few of these epitopes, not necessarily all of them. However, when we get re-infected or get a booster vaccine, our immune system learns about more epitopes. It’s like improving our home security by getting more locks for our doors. The more “locks” our antibodies recognize, the better they can protect us from different versions of the virus.\n\n\n\n\n\nExamples of Canyon Protein on Poliovirus Particle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExamples of Canyon Protein on Poliovirus Particle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAntibodies Preventing the Fusion of the Influenza Virus with Cell Membrane\n\n\n\n\nOur immune system uses antibodies to defend against viruses, but these antibodies are quite large and can’t always access every part of a virus’s proteins. Imagine these antibodies as big keys trying to unlock a door. Some keyholes are hidden or only partially exposed, making them hard for the antibodies to reach.\nAs a result, critical sites on virus proteins, like where the virus attaches to our cells, might stay hidden from our antibodies. However, antibodies can still protect us by interfering with other aspects of the virus’s attack, like preventing it from sticking to our cells.\nIn some cases, though, antibodies can’t provide protection because the virus, like HIV-1, keeps changing over time. It’s like the virus is constantly changing its locks, making it hard for our immune system to find the right keys.\n\n\n6.2.2 Vaccines Promote Health\n\n\n\n\n\nInfographic Pertaining to Vaccine Statistics\n\n\n\n\nVaccines are like super shields that help keep us healthy. They’re especially good at preventing diseases that could make us sick. In a way, vaccines clear a path for our lives to go smoothly and let us grow without big health hurdles.\nBut they’re not just about one person – vaccines are like superheroes that protect whole communities and even entire populations. They work quickly, so when we get vaccinated, the effects kick in almost right away.\nPlus, vaccines do something really amazing – they save lives and money. In fact, they’re one of the most cost-effective ways to keep us healthy.\n\n\n6.2.3 Vaccine Cost and Production\n\n\n\n\n\nVaccine Development Costs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVaccine Development Costs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVaccine Development Costs\n\n\n\n\nBig pharmaceutical companies are typically the ones that make vaccines. Not only do they have the money to do so (whether it comes from drug sales or from funding from generous donors), but they also have the resources and the technology to mass produce them in a safe and efficient manner.\n\n\n6.2.4 Components of Vaccines\nA vaccine has three parts to it:\n\nAntigens: These are like the “wanted posters” for our immune system. They help our body recognize and fight the virus. They’re the key ingredient that gets our immune system into action.\nStabilizers: Think of them as the “bodyguards” for the vaccine (e.g, MgCl2 in OPV vaccines and MgSO4 in measles vaccines). They keep it safe and stable during storage. These bodyguards need to be picky about where they work – things like temperature and pH matter.\nAdjuvants: These are like the cheerleaders for our immune system. They boost, speed up, and extend the immune response, so our body is ready to fight off the virus. But sometimes they can get a little too excited, leading to an overactive immune response. So, adjuvants are a bit like our immune system’s personal trainers, making sure it’s in the best shape to protect us.\n\n\n6.2.4.1 Adjuvants\nAdjuvants are like booster engines for vaccines, helping them do their job effectively.\nWhen it comes to live or weakened virus vaccines, they are good at activating both the cell-mediated and humoral immune responses. But not all vaccines are as versatile. Inactivated virus vaccines, for example, might not be able to activate both types of responses on their own. So, to give them a little boost, adjuvants are used.\nA common adjuvant is made from aluminum hydroxide or aluminum phosphate salts. These adjuvants are like cheerleaders for the immune system, specifically encouraging type 2 T helper lymphocytes. These cells are important for producing antibodies.\nHowever, aluminum adjuvants might not be the best fit when we want to trigger a different type of immune response, called Th1-like. For that, we’re developing new adjuvants, like oil-in-water-based ones. These can broaden the antibody responses and are being used in some human influenza vaccines in the EU.\nSome adjuvants can even interact with specific parts of the immune system, like TLRs. Imagine them as unique keys that can unlock a specific type of immune response.\n\n\n\n\n\nComposition of the Measles Vaccine\n\n\n\n\nAntibiotics and preservatives in vaccines play important roles in keeping vaccines safe and effective.\nAntibiotics, like neomycin, are used in the manufacturing process to protect the vaccine from bacterial contamination. This ensures that the vaccines produced are free from harmful bacteria. However, only tiny amounts of these antibiotics end up in the final vaccine, typically less than 25μg per dose. While this amount is usually safe, it can be a concern for individuals with antibiotic allergies, especially neomycin allergies.\nPreservatives, such as thiomersal, formaldehyde, or phenol derivatives, are added to multi-dose vaccines. These preservatives help prevent the growth of harmful bacteria and fungi in the vaccine over time. They act like guardians, ensuring that the vaccine remains free from unwanted microbial contamination. This is particularly important for vaccines that come in multi-dose vials, as each dose must be as safe and effective as the first."

    "section": "6.3 Categories of Virus Vaccines",
    "text": "6.3 Categories of Virus Vaccines\n\n6.3.1 Live Virus Vaccine\nLive wild-type vaccines are straightforward and efficient tools for preventing disease.\nIn this approach, a virus that typically infects one animal species can be used to infect another closely related species to protect it against a similar pathogen. The key is that the virus used in the vaccine is not adapted to the new host, which means it has limited or no pathogenicity and doesn’t cause disease. However, it’s effective at generating an immune response because it shares important immunogenic determinants with the target pathogen.\nFor example, vaccinia virus is currently used as a live wild-type vaccine to prevent poxvirus infections in humans, even though there’s no naturally circulating human poxvirus. This approach has been successful in preventing diseases by leveraging related viruses to stimulate the immune system and protect against harmful pathogens.\n\n\n6.3.2 Live Attenuated Virus Vaccine\n\n\n\n\n\nProduction of a Live Attenuated Virus Vaccine\n\n\n\n\nLive attenuated virus vaccines are created by passing a pathogenic virus through various systems, such as animals, cells, or eggs. This process leads to the virus acquiring mutations that reduce its ability to cause disease while still allowing it to replicate.\nThe resulting attenuated virus can be used as a vaccine. When administered to humans, it can replicate within the body and induce a protective immune response. For example, the Edmonston B vaccine and the Moraten strain, which is a further attenuated measles vaccine developed in 1968, are examples of this approach. These vaccines are made from cold-adapted viruses, meaning they have limited growth at human body temperature (37°C).\nAnother example is the live attenuated influenza vaccine, which is created by reassorting the H and N genes with segments of other influenza viruses. This engineered virus can replicate in cooler areas of the airway, like the nasal mucosa, but not in the warmer lung environment. This approach has been successful in generating immunity without causing the disease itself.\n\n6.3.2.1 Basis for Attenuation\nThe basis for attenuation in live attenuated virus vaccines lies in the accumulation of mutations through selective passage in an unnatural host. This process results in many mutations occurring in the virus. Interestingly, it is often challenging to pinpoint the specific genetic changes that lead to attenuation, and in many cases, the genetic basis for attenuation remains poorly understood.\nThe primary effect of these attenuating mutations is to reduce the levels of virus replication in the host, particularly at the portal of entry. As a result, the virus is unable to cause significant disease in the host. This reduction in replication capacity is a key factor that makes live attenuated virus vaccines effective in stimulating a protective immune response without causing severe illness.\n\n\n\n\n\nPoliovirus’ IRES\n\n\n\n\nAttenuating mutations in live attenuated virus vaccines can manifest in both non-coding regions (NCR) and coding regions of the virus genome. For instance, mutations in the 5’ NCR (non-coding region) of the poliovirus genome have the effect of altering the predicted secondary structure. This alteration in structure decreases virus replication by affecting the function of the neural-tissue-specific IRES (Internal Ribosome Entry Site). In simpler terms, these mutations disrupt the virus’s ability to replicate effectively, which is a critical part of why it doesn’t cause severe illness when administered as a vaccine.\nAnother example is seen in adenovirus vaccines, where attenuating mutations are employed to limit infection to a specific area of the body, typically the gut. This restriction prevents the virus from causing disease in other parts of the body. This strategy is an essential component of live attenuated virus vaccines, as it ensures that the virus remains harmless while still promoting a strong immune response.\n\n\n6.3.2.2 Pros of Live Attenuated Viruses\nThere are several advantages to using wild-type or live attenuated virus vaccines:\n\nRepresentative Immune Response: These vaccines trigger an immune response that closely resembles what happens during a natural infection. This is advantageous because it leads to a more comprehensive and effective immune defense.\nLong-Lasting Immunity: Vaccination with live attenuated vaccines can provide long-lasting immunity. This means that individuals may remain protected against the virus for an extended period, often years or even a lifetime.\nSimplified Delivery: Live attenuated virus vaccines can be administered through various routes, such as orally or nasally. This versatility in administration simplifies the process of delivering vaccines, making them more accessible and convenient.\nMimicking Natural Infection: By using the same routes of administration as natural infection, such as with the oral Sabin polio vaccine or the nasal FluMist influenza vaccine, these vaccines mimic the way the virus typically enters the body. This approach enhances the vaccine’s effectiveness and helps the immune system recognize and respond to the virus more effectively.\n\n\n\n6.3.2.3 Cons of Live Attenuated Viruses\n\n\n\n\n\nRate of Mutations in Viruses\n\n\n\n\nLive attenuated virus vaccines have several limitations:\n\nManufacturing Costs: These vaccines can be expensive to produce. The process of generating and maintaining live attenuated strains requires careful monitoring and quality control, which can increase manufacturing costs.\nStability and Cold Chain Requirements: Live attenuated vaccines are relatively unstable and can be sensitive to environmental conditions. Many of them require constant refrigeration, which can be a challenge in resource-limited settings. Maintaining a “cold chain” to preserve vaccine viability during storage and transportation is essential but can be logistically complex.\nSafety Concerns for Immunocompromised Individuals: Live attenuated vaccines may pose a risk to individuals with weakened or abnormal immune systems, such as those with certain medical conditions or undergoing immunosuppressive treatments. In such cases, the vaccine virus could cause serious illness.\nReversion to Virulence: Although these vaccines are designed to be less virulent than the wild-type virus, there is a slight risk of reversion to a more virulent form. This reversion could lead to the vaccine virus causing disease instead of conferring immunity. For example, in rare instances, the Sabin polio vaccine strains have reverted to neurovirulent forms.\nLimited Coverage: Some live attenuated vaccines, like the trivalent oral polio vaccine (consisting of Sabin strains 1, 2, and 3), may not provide complete protection against all circulating strains of the virus. This limitation can be addressed by using other vaccine types, like inactivated vaccines, in combination with live attenuated vaccines.\n\n\n\n\n6.3.3 Inactivated Virus Vaccine\nInactivated virus vaccines work differently. First, they grow the virus in things like eggs or cells. Then, they purify the virus, which means they clean it up. After that, they use something like formaldehyde, detergent, or high heat to stop the virus from working. But the important part, the virus parts that help our immune system, is still there.\nThe cool thing is that these inactivated viruses can’t make us sick because they can’t grow or spread. An example of this kind of vaccine is the Salk inactivated polio vaccine (IPV). It’s a safe way to help our bodies learn to fight the virus without us getting sick from it.\n\n6.3.3.1 Pros and Cons of Inactivated Virus Vaccines\nInactivated virus vaccines have their own advantages and limitations. On the bright side, they can teach our immune system about lots of different parts of the virus. They’re also easier to store because they don’t need to be super cold, which makes them more convenient. Plus, they’re safer because they can’t cause an infection.\n\n\n\n\n\nLive Attenuated Virus Vaccine Antibody Production\n\n\n\n\nHowever, there are some downsides too. These vaccines can be pretty costly to make. They might not give us as long-lasting protection because they can’t fully mimic a real infection. So, we might need several shots to stay safe. And, unlike some other vaccines, they can’t be just put in your mouth or nose – they have to be injected with a needle. Often, they also need an extra boost from something called an adjuvant to work their best.\n\n\n6.3.3.2 Adminstering Killed Vaccines\n\n\n\n\n\nAdministration Routes for Vaccines\n\n\n\n\nVaccines are given in different ways. Some are injected into a muscle (intramuscular) using a needle, which is often the case when they have special boosters called adjuvants. Others are injected under the skin (subcutaneous), and some are given with a very tiny needle in the top layer of the skin (intradermal). There are also vaccines you can take by mouth, so no needles are needed. And for some, there’s a special spray you can breathe in through your nose, again avoiding needles. These different methods help people get their vaccines in the way that’s most comfortable and effective for them.\n\n6.3.3.2.1 Giving Influenza Virus Vaccines\n\n\n\n\n\nGiving a Flu Vaccine\n\n\n\n\nGenerally speaking, it’s easier to give live attenuated viruses (i.e., vaccines with a weakened virus) than it is to give a killed virus.\n\n\n\n\n6.3.4 Subunit Virus Vaccines\nSubunit virus vaccines are made from parts of the virus that are known to trigger a strong immune response. They don’t contain the virus’s genetic material and can’t cause infection. These vaccines are often less expensive to make. Sometimes, these purified virus proteins can even stick together and form virus-like particles, which can be even better at getting the immune system’s attention. This is a safe and effective way to make vaccines that help protect us from dangerous viruses.\n\n6.3.4.1 Virus Like Particles\n\n\n\n\n\nExamples of Virus-Like Particles\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExamples of Virus-Like Particles\n\n\n\n\nVirus-like particles are a special kind of subunit virus vaccine. They’re made to look like the real virus, with a similar structure and shape, but they don’t have the virus’s genetic material. These vaccines are already available for some viruses like HPV in the form of Cervarix and Gardasil. They help our immune system learn how to fight the real virus. Researchers are also working on making these vaccines for other viruses like the flu and parvovirus, which could help protect us from these diseases too.\n\n\n6.3.4.2 Pros and Cons of Subunit Virus Vaccines\nSubunit virus vaccines, like virus-like particles, have some good things going for them. They’re easier and cheaper to make than other types of vaccines. They’re also stable, meaning they don’t need special conditions for storage. This type of vaccine doesn’t usually have side effects like some others might, making them a safer option. And they can be given to people with weakened immune systems, which is important for those who might be more vulnerable to infections.\nThere are some downsides to subunit virus vaccines as well. Because they don’t cause an actual infection, they might not provide long-lasting protection. You might need more than one dose to make sure you’re well-protected. These vaccines usually need an extra ingredient called an adjuvant to work effectively. And, they’re typically given through an injection, which isn’t always fun.\n\n\n\n6.3.5 mRNA Vaccines\nLet’s break down how mRNA vaccines work. These vaccines contain a tiny piece of genetic material called mRNA, which is like a set of instructions from the virus. This mRNA is delivered to your body using very small particles called nanoparticles. When it’s inside your body, the mRNA acts as a recipe to make a piece of the virus, but not the whole virus. This piece then triggers your immune system to respond, which helps protect you from the virus if you ever encounter it in the future. It’s like a practice run for your immune system.\n\n6.3.5.1 Structure of mRNA in Vaccines\n\n\n\n\n\nStructure of an mRNA Transcript\n\n\n\n\nThe mRNA that is used in vaccines is like a set of instructions written in a specific language. This language has its own alphabet made of letters called nucleotides. To make sure the instructions are clear and work properly, we need to consider a few things.\nFirst, the purity of the mRNA is crucial. Even tiny bits of other stuff mixed in can make the instructions less effective.\nThe mRNA has a beginning and an end. Think of it like a story. The starting and ending parts of the mRNA, called the 5’ and 3’ untranslated regions (UTRs), can affect how well the instructions are understood by the cell. Also, the length of a specific part called the polyA tail matters.\nThe 5’cap is like the title of the story. It’s at the very beginning and is important for translation.\nSometimes, we need to make the instructions more understandable for the cell, and this is called codon optimization. It’s like rephrasing the instructions to be clearer and more efficient. We can even use special letter changes (modified nucleosides) to help with this. It’s all about making sure the mRNA instructions are as good as they can be.\n\n\n6.3.5.2 Classes of mRNA Vaccines\n\n\n\n\n\nDifferent Kinds of mRNA Vaccines\n\n\n\n\nThere are two main types of RNA vaccines, each with its unique features:\n\nNRM (Non-Replicating mRNA): This type of RNA vaccine contains the instructions for making a part of the virus, like its outer coat. But it doesn’t have the ability to replicate itself. It’s like giving your cells a snapshot of the virus, so they know how to recognize it and fight it off. To deliver these instructions into your cells, they are enclosed in tiny lipid nanoparticles, like a protective bubble.\nSAM (Self-Amplifying mRNA): SAM vaccines are a bit different. They not only carry the instructions for making a piece of the virus but also the tools to replicate themselves. It’s like giving your cells a small machine that can make copies of the instructions. These special machines come from other viruses like Semliki-Forest and Sindbis viruses. They also need lipid nanoparticles to help deliver the instructions.\n\nBoth types of vaccines use lipid nanoparticles to get the instructions inside your cells. These instructions teach your cells how to make a piece of the virus, so your immune system can learn to recognize and fight the virus if it ever comes along. It’s like a training program for your immune system!\n\n\n6.3.5.3 Pros and Cons of mRNA Vaccines\nOne good thing about mRNA vaccines is that they are quick to make. All you need is the instructions for a specific part of the virus. This makes it faster to create vaccines when we need them, especially during big outbreaks like pandemics.\nAnother plus is that these vaccines can be made in large quantities. This is really important during a pandemic when many people need protection.\nBut there are some challenges too. This is a new technology, so people need to understand how it works and be okay with it. We still need to make these vaccines even better and safer. That means studying and improving them more.\nAnd there’s one more thing to watch out for. We need to keep an eye on the virus. Sometimes it can change and become immune to the vaccine. We need to figure out how to handle this.\n\n\n\n6.3.6 Other Categories of Vaccines\nThere are a few covered here:\n\nChimeric Vaccines\n\n\n\n\n\nHow Chimeric Vaccines Work\n\n\n\n\nChimeric vaccines are a bit like mix-and-match. We can take some not-so-harmful viruses and change them to have parts of another virus. This way, they can help our immune system learn how to fight that other virus. It’s like giving our body a sneak peek at the enemy’s weaknesses.\nDNA Vaccines\n\n\n\n\n\nProduction of DNA Vaccines\n\n\n\n\nChimeric vaccines are a bit like mix-and-match. We can take some not-so-harmful viruses and change them to have parts of another virus. This way, they can help our immune system learn how to fight that other virus. It’s like giving our body a sneak peek at the enemy’s weaknesses.\nNanoparticles\n\n\n\n\n\nIllustration of a Nanoparticle Vaccine\n\n\n\n\nNanoparticles are like tiny platforms where virus parts can stand. These virus parts are the things that our immune system recognizes and fights against. Some nanoparticles show these virus parts on their surface, like a badge. Others are like little containers, holding the virus parts inside. There are also vaccines made of tiny pieces from the virus, like a mix of jigsaw puzzle pieces. All these tricks help our immune system practice recognizing and fighting the virus."

    "text": "6.4 Goals of Vaccination\n\n6.4.1 Prevention\n\n\n\n\n\nExample of Prevention as a Result of Vaccination\n\n\n\n\nPreventing disease is a big reason for vaccines. They help control diseases in a whole group of people, like in a town or country. Most vaccines are given before someone gets sick. But sometimes, if you’ve been around a really bad virus, you can get a special vaccine after to stop the virus from making you sick. An example of this is the rabies vaccine, which you might get after a risky animal bite.\n\n\n\n\n\nIllustration of Herd Immunity\n\n\n\n\nSome vaccines not only protect the person who gets them but also help keep the whole community safe. This is called herd immunity. It means that when many people in a community get vaccinated, it’s hard for the virus to spread. So, even people who can’t get vaccinated are safer because most others around them are protected.\n\n\n\n\n\nVaccination Prevents Illnesses\n\n\n\n\nMost vaccines stop you from getting sick if you’re exposed to a virus, but they don’t always stop you from getting the virus. For example, the vaccine for hepatitis B helps prevent the virus from spreading from an infected mother to her baby. This is important to protect newborns from the virus.\n\n6.4.1.1 Global Vaccination Coverage\n\n\n\n\n\nGlobal Vaccination Coverage by Disease\n\n\n\n\nGlobal vaccination coverage means how many children around the world get the vaccines they need to stay healthy. It’s important for as many children as possible to get vaccinated to prevent diseases from spreading.\nExperts have identified five important factors to make sure that vaccination coverage is high. First, we need good data to know who needs vaccines and if they are getting them. Second, communities should be involved in deciding about vaccines and making sure everyone can get them. Third, it’s important that even people in hard-to-reach places or those who have been forced from their homes can still get vaccines. Fourth, a strong healthcare system is needed to make sure vaccines are given out properly. And fifth, vaccines must be available everywhere, all the time, so that anyone who needs them can get them. These are the key factors to make sure that as many children as possible are protected from dangerous diseases through vaccination.\n\n\n\n\n\nYellow Fever Prevalence in Africa\n\n\n\n\nVaccines have since become an important part of medication when travelling (i.e., travel medicine).\n\n\n\n6.4.2 Eradication\nEradication is when we completely get rid of a disease, making it no longer a threat to people. To do this, we need to stop the virus from being in a host, which is like the home of the virus. Viruses can be in different hosts, like animals or humans. Sometimes, a virus can go from a host to another, causing infections.\nThe kind of host the virus comes from is important to control the infection in people. The relationship between the host and the virus can be complicated. For example, yellow fever virus has two cycles: one in the jungle and one in cities. In the jungle, it’s carried by mosquitoes and monkeys.\nEradication is easier if there’s no known animal host, like with smallpox. But if the virus has an insect host, like YFV, it’s more complex. Eradication is a big goal in fighting diseases, and understanding the role of different hosts is important in this effort.\n\n6.4.2.1 Smallpox Virus\n\n\n\n\n\nSmallpox Vaccination Efforts During the 1900s\n\n\n\n\nSmallpox was a terrible disease, but thanks to a powerful vaccine and the fact that it only lived in humans (it had no animal host), we were able to completely get rid of it. In 1950, the World Health Organization decided to work on getting rid of smallpox in the Americas. This was a big effort.\nThey used a very effective vaccine to protect people from smallpox. Because there were no animals involved in spreading the virus, it was easier to control and eventually eliminate smallpox. This was a huge success in the fight against diseases, and it’s a good example of how vaccines and focused efforts can make a big difference.\nIn 1965, the World Health Organization began a campaign to wipe out smallpox all over the world. People were vaccinated on a global scale to protect them from this disease. It was a big effort.\nBy the mid-1970s, even babies were getting vaccinated against smallpox. This helped ensure they didn’t get sick from the virus.\nThe last time anyone got sick with smallpox from natural sources was in Somalia in 1977. It was a really big deal when someone saw a rash that looked like smallpox because it meant the virus might still be around.\nBut in December 1979, the World Health Organization made a historic announcement. They said that smallpox was completely gone from the world! This was a huge achievement because it was the first time ever that we had completely eliminated a disease caused by microbes (tiny living things like viruses). It showed the world that with hard work and vaccinations, we could get rid of even the deadliest diseases.\n\n\n6.4.2.2 Poliovirus\n\n\n\n\n\nPolio Victims\n\n\n\n\nIn 1955, a scientist named Jonas Salk started testing his special polio vaccine. It wasn’t a live virus, but a killed one, which means it couldn’t make people sick. He wanted to see if it could protect people from getting polio.\nAround the same time, another scientist named Albert Sabin was working on a different kind of polio vaccine. His vaccine used a live virus, but it was very weak, so it couldn’t give people full-blown polio. In 1957, they started trying it out on people, and by 1960, it was being used widely. These vaccines were a big step forward in protecting people from polio, a very serious disease.\nBack in May 1988, the World Health Organization (WHO) made a big decision. They wanted to get rid of polio, a disease that was making people very sick, by the year 2004. It was like a worldwide mission to make sure no one got polio anymore.\nBut here’s the thing: in 2015, we were still seeing cases of polio caused by the virus in nature, even though we had the technology to stop it. The problem wasn’t about what we could do; it was more about politics and other issues that were getting in the way. So, while we made a lot of progress, we still had some work to do to completely get rid of polio.\n\n\n\n6.4.3 Vaccination for Pets\n\n\n\n\n\nAnimation Vaccination Guides\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnimation Vaccination Guides"

    "section": "6.5 Challenges for Vaccination",
    "text": "6.5 Challenges for Vaccination\n\n6.5.1 Immunization in Early and Later Life\nFor babies, they have something called maternal antibodies. These are like shields given to them by their moms. Sometimes, these shields can interfere with the vaccines. For example, a special kind of vaccine for measles doesn’t work well when given to very young babies, so we wait until they are at least 1 year old.\nNow, as people get older, their immune system ages too. It’s like the immune system gets a bit tired. So, when you’re elderly, your body might not respond as well to vaccines, and you might need more booster shots to keep your immunity strong. It’s a bit like charging your phone more often when the battery starts getting weak.\n\n\n6.5.2 Adverse Events Following Immunization (i.e., AEFI)\n\n\n\n\n\nExamples of AEFIs in Vaccines\n\n\n\n\nWhen it comes to vaccines, they are usually very safe and made with high standards to make sure they don’t harm people. But in very rare cases, some people might have bad reactions after getting a vaccine.\nThe reason for these bad reactions can vary. Sometimes, it’s because of something related to the virus the vaccine is supposed to protect against. For example, in extremely rare cases, the polio vaccine can cause a problem called vaccine-associated paralytic polio. It’s like the vaccine temporarily acts a bit like the actual disease.\nThese bad reactions are not easy to understand or predict because they happen so rarely. But here’s the thing: the risk of having a bad reaction from a vaccine is much, much lower than the risk of getting sick from the actual virus. So, even though these rare reactions can be scary, it’s still safer for the whole community to get vaccinated. That way, it helps to stop the virus from spreading.\nHowever, when people hear about these rare bad reactions, it can make them worried about getting vaccinated. That’s why public health experts work hard to explain the risks and benefits of vaccines, so people understand that the benefits of vaccination usually far outweigh the risks.\nCertainly, here’s a simplified version:\nSometimes, vaccines that were used in the past didn’t work very well and could actually make people sicker. For example, there was a measles vaccine in the 1960s that didn’t give good protection, and it caused a different kind of measles infection.\nAnother example is a vaccine for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). People who got this vaccine actually had a worse RSV infection and got sicker.\nThese are old examples, and vaccines today are much better and safer. Scientists learn from the past and make sure new vaccines work well and don’t cause these kinds of problems.\n\n\n6.5.3 Misinformation and Poltiics\n\n\n\n\n\nAnti-Vaxxer Propaganda\n\n\n\n\nSometimes, people spread false information about vaccines. For example, there was a fake report that said the measles vaccine could cause autism. This scared some parents, and they didn’t want to get their kids vaccinated. As a result, more kids got sick with measles in the UK.\nAlso, on the internet and social media, there are groups of people who say vaccines are bad and try to convince others not to get vaccinated. This can be a problem because vaccines are important for keeping us healthy and safe. It’s important to listen to real doctors and scientists who say that vaccines are a good way to prevent diseases.\n\n\n6.5.4 Vaccination Costs\n\n\n\n\n\nCost of Vaccinations\n\n\n\n\nVaccines might be too expensive to afford for the layperson, and this is a cause for concern among low-income individuals (especially in developing countries). New technologies can potentially be used to lower costs.\n\n\n6.5.5 Antibody Escape Mechanism\nViruses can be very tricky. They can change themselves a little bit to escape from the antibodies our bodies make to fight them. It’s like hiding from the good guys. Some viruses even have a special trick - they make something to distract our immune system, so it doesn’t attack the real virus.\nTo make a good vaccine, we need to make sure it teaches our bodies to fight the virus in different ways. This way, even if the virus tries to hide or distract our immune system, we’ll be ready to stop it."

    "text": "Re-emerging viruses were once a big deal for people’s health, causing significant problems. Over time, though, these issues went down. However, now they’re making a comeback and causing health problems again.\nAn emerging virus is a newly discovered virus that has the potential to spread more and make people sick. It’s like a virus that’s just been found and has the ability to increase in how often it shows up and lead to diseases.\nSeveral factors play a role in the emergence of viruses:\nFirstly, viruses can adapt over time through processes like mutation, which means they change in a way that allows them to spread more easily.\nSecondly, climate change is another factor. As the Earth’s climate shifts, it can create conditions that favor the growth and spread of new viruses.\nThirdly, economic development activities such as deforestation and changes in land use can contribute to the emergence of viruses. When we alter the environment, it can affect the balance between viruses and their hosts.\nFourthly, rapid travel, especially between continents, can speed up the spread of viruses. People moving quickly from one place to another can carry viruses with them, leading to new outbreaks in different regions.\nFifthly, the breakdown of public health care systems, particularly during times of war or crisis, can create conditions that allow viruses to thrive and spread.\nAdditionally, factors like poverty and social inequality can also contribute to the emergence of viruses. Limited access to healthcare and poor living conditions can make it easier for viruses to affect communities.\nFurthermore, the intentional use of viruses for harmful purposes, known as bioterrorism, is another factor that can lead to the emergence of dangerous viruses.\nLastly, advancements in bioscience, such as the cost associated with developing effective vaccines, can influence the emergence of viruses. The availability and affordability of preventive measures play a crucial role in controlling the spread of viruses."

    "text": "7.1 Human Pathogens\n\n\n\n\n\nReservoirs of Human Hosts\n\n\n\n\nHuman pathogens use different strategies to spread:\nSome viruses persist in humans by staying in a chronic or latent state with no other reservoir. For example, the Herpes simplex virus operates this way.\nOthers don’t stick around in humans but need to keep infecting new human hosts to survive. Diseases like measles and poliomyelitis follow this strategy.\nThen, there are viruses that mainly hang out in nonhuman hosts and only accidentally infect humans. Rabies is an example of a virus that works this way. It’s important to note that some viruses, like influenza and SARS, can adapt to spread between humans. This adaptation is a significant source for the emergence of new viruses that infect humans.\n\n\n\n\n\nLinks Between Reservoirs and Intermediate Hosts\n\n\n\n\nIt may not always be possible to remove the intermediate hosts (e.g., bats are important to the ecosystem, culling pigs would severely hurt a country’s economy, etc).\n\n7.1.1 Influenza Viruses\n\n\n\n\n\nCharacteristics (underlined) of the Flu Virus\n\n\n\n\nInfluenza viruses serve as a notable example of a virus that constantly poses emerging, reemerging, and current threats to public health. Understanding the principles involved and related issues in dealing with influenza is crucial. It’s important to note that while the discussion focuses on influenza, the same principles can be applied to other emerging viruses, such as the SARS-CoV-2 virus responsible for COVID-19.\nInfluenza is considered an emerging threat because it undergoes changes, or mutations, allowing new strains to emerge regularly. These changes can make existing vaccines less effective, requiring scientists to continually update them to match the evolving virus. The virus can also reemerge, causing outbreaks or pandemics, as seen in historical events like the Spanish flu of 1918. Additionally, influenza remains a current threat, with seasonal flu outbreaks affecting communities worldwide.\nThe principles involved in addressing influenza include monitoring and understanding the virus’s ability to change, developing effective vaccines, and implementing measures for prevention and control. Issues related to influenza management encompass the need for global collaboration in surveillance, the challenges of predicting which strains will dominate in a given season, and the importance of timely and widespread vaccination efforts.\nWhile the focus here is on influenza, these principles and issues are applicable to other emerging viruses, such as SARS-CoV-2. Just as with influenza, understanding the genetic variations, developing effective vaccines, and establishing robust public health measures are critical components in addressing and mitigating the impact of emerging viruses on a global scale.\n\n7.1.1.1 Categorizing Influenza Viruses\nIn the world of influenza viruses, classification is a key tool for scientists to understand their diverse nature. These viruses are divided into types A, B, and C, based on differences in the antigens found in their nucleocapsid (NP) and matrix (M) proteins. An intriguing addition to this classification is the relatively new D subtype, identified in cattle. Fortunately, as of now, this subtype is not known to infect humans. This system of categorization allows researchers to discern specific characteristics of each influenza virus, paving the way for targeted studies and strategic prevention measures.\nAnother facet of influenza classification involves the host specificity of each virus type. Influenza A, with its broad reach, can infect avian, human, and various mammalian species, including swine. Influenza B, in contrast, primarily targets humans, while Influenza C is mainly associated with human infections. This distinction in host preferences is crucial in understanding the potential impact and transmission dynamics of different influenza viruses within various populations.\nDelving deeper into the molecular realm, each influenza virus type boasts a distinct set of proteins. While these proteins often share functional similarities, they are expressed from different genomic segments. In the case of Influenza A and B viruses, there are 8 genomic segments, whereas Influenza C (and D) virus possesses 7 segments. This genetic diversity contributes to the adaptability and evolution of influenza viruses, influencing their ability to infect different hosts and evade immune responses.\nFurthermore, scientists employ subtyping based on the antigenicity of surface spike proteins to gain a finer understanding of each influenza virus. This additional layer of classification allows researchers to discern specific strains within each virus type, aiding in the development of vaccines and targeted intervention strategies. In summary, the intricate classification of influenza viruses provides a roadmap for scientists, offering valuable insights into their behavior, potential threats, and avenues for effective control and prevention.\n\n\n7.1.1.2 Structure of Influenza Viruses\n\n\n\n\n\nStructure of a Typical Influenza Virus\n\n\n\n\nThe structure of influenza viruses is fascinatingly intricate. Encased in a lipid envelope, which is enriched in raft lipids and derived from the host cell, these viral particles are relatively small, ranging from 80 to 120 nanometers in diameter. What makes them visually distinctive are the protein spikes that radiate from the virus. Among these spikes, there’s the rod-shaped haemagglutinin (HA) and the mushroom-shaped neuraminidase (NA).\nBeneath this outer layer, the genome of the influenza virus consists of negative-sense RNA segments. An interesting aspect is that the virus carries its own RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RDRP). This polymerase is crucial for the virus to replicate its RNA. The NP, PB1, PB2, and PA proteins come together to form the viral RNP (ribonucleoprotein), creating a distinct structure known as the RNP. This structure plays a key role in the virus’s ability to hijack host cells for its own replication.\nWithin the viral envelope, there are low levels of other integral virus membrane proteins, including M2, NB, and CM2. These proteins contribute to various functions in the virus life cycle. Additionally, the virus matrix (M) protein underlies the virus envelope, providing structural support to the overall architecture of the influenza virus."

    "text": "7.2 Variation Between Viruses\n\n7.2.1 Antigenic Drift\n\n\n\n\n\nSites of Antigenic Drift\n\n\n\n\n“Antigenic drift” is a term used to describe minor changes in the antigenic nature of influenza viruses. These changes result from accumulated amino acid changes, with a primary focus on two key proteins: hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA). This phenomenon is relevant to influenza A, B, and C viruses.\nHistorical examples of antigenic drift include the H1N1 virus responsible for the 1918 Spanish flu, the H2N2 virus associated with the 1957 Asian flu, and the H3N2 virus linked to the 1968 Hong Kong flu. In the case of the HA protein, antigenic drift occurs through amino acid changes at five specific antigenic sites, giving rise to different influenza virus subtypes. These changes have a significant impact as they prevent the binding of antibodies generated from previous infections, making it challenging for the immune system to recognize and defend against the modified virus.\nIn human influenza A viruses, antibody selection plays a role in driving antigenic drift. The immune system’s response to previous infections influences the evolution of the virus by selecting for variants that can escape existing antibodies. Antigenic sites are also identified in the NA protein, adding another layer to the complexity of influenza virus evolution.\n\n\n7.2.2 Reassortment\n\n\n\n\n\nReassortment\n\n\n\n\nReassortment is a phenomenon observed in influenza A, B, and C viruses, where these viruses have the ability to create reassorted or mixed viruses. This occurs when two different influenza viruses infect the same host cell, leading to the exchange of genetic material between the two viruses.\nAn illustrative example of reassortment is seen in the influenza A virus A/Kong Kong/68 H3N2. In this case, the reassorted virus contains genes for the hemagglutinin (HA) and polymerase basic 1 (PB1) from an H3 virus and the neuraminidase (NA) and five other genes from a circulating H2N2 virus. This mixing of genetic material can result in a new virus with a combination of genetic elements from different parental viruses.\n\n\n7.2.3 Alternative Reading Frames\n\n\n\n\n\nFragments\n\n\n\n\nAlternative reading frames, exemplified by the PB1-F2 protein, introduce an intriguing layer of complexity to influenza viruses. The PB1-F2 protein is encoded by alternative reading frames on a specific genomic segment and gives rise to both the traditional PB1 protein and the unique PB1-F2 protein. It’s important to note that this alternative reading frame is not present in all influenza viruses.\nThis distinctive reading frame has been identified in significant influenza pandemic strains, including those from 1918, 1957, and 1968. The PB1-F2 protein is proposed to play a role in inducing apoptosis, a process of programmed cell death, particularly in macrophages. This programmed cell death in macrophages, which are immune cells that play a key role in defense against infections, can have implications for the pathogenicity of the virus.\nThe impact extends to alveolar macrophages, which are crucial in defending the lungs. If these macrophages are impaired due to the actions of PB1-F2, it can contribute to the severity of the infection. Additionally, the PB1-F2 protein has been implicated in facilitating bacterial secondary infections, adding another layer of complexity to the interplay between the influenza virus and the host immune response. Understanding the role of alternative reading frames like PB1-F2 provides insights into the various strategies employed by influenza viruses to modulate host responses and influence the course of infection."

    "text": "7.3 The Influenza Virus\n\n7.3.1 Human Transmission\nHuman transmission of influenza primarily occurs through human-to-human contact, often facilitated by the spread of respiratory droplets in the form of aerosols. This mode of transmission is a key factor in the occurrence of both epidemics and pandemics of influenza.\nEpidemics are characterized by the widespread occurrence of influenza within a specific region or community. Seasonal influenza, a familiar term, refers to the regular, often annual, occurrence of epidemics. The size and impact of these epidemics are closely linked to the immunologic status of the population. The concept of herd immunity, where a significant portion of the population becomes immune to a specific virus either through vaccination or previous infection, plays a crucial role in mitigating the spread of influenza during epidemics. The higher the level of immunity in the population, the more challenging it is for the virus to find susceptible individuals, thus limiting the scale of the epidemic.\n\n7.3.1.0.1 Pandemics\n\n\n\n\n\nWHO’s Definition of a Pandemic\n\n\n\n\nPandemics in the context of influenza occur when a new subtype of the virus, not previously encountered by the existing human population, emerges. The critical characteristic distinguishing pandemics from regular epidemics is the lack or limited presence of preexisting immunity in the population. Unlike seasonal epidemics, where some level of immunity may exist due to previous exposure or vaccination, pandemics arise from influenza strains that are entirely new to the human immune system.\nThe degree of severity associated with a pandemic depends on the specific characteristics of the emerging strain. Some pandemic strains may exhibit mild symptoms and lower fatality rates, while others can be more severe and pose significant public health challenges. The unpredictability of the severity is a distinctive feature of pandemics, making it crucial for public health authorities to closely monitor and respond to emerging strains to mitigate their impact on the global population.\n\n\n7.3.1.1 Antiviral Drugs Against Influenza Virus\nAntiviral drugs play a crucial role in managing influenza, and two classes of such drugs are Amantadine/Zamantadine and Zanamivir/Oseltamivir (Tamiflu™).\nAmantadine and Zamantadine are among the oldest antiviral medications used against influenza. They primarily target influenza A viruses by inhibiting the M2 protein. However, one significant challenge with these drugs is the development of resistance, limiting their effectiveness in some cases.\nOn the other hand, Zanamivir and Oseltamivir (Tamiflu™) belong to a relatively newer class known as neuraminidase inhibitors. These drugs work by mimicking the natural substrate, sialic acid, of the neuraminidase (NA) protein on the surface of influenza viruses. By doing so, they prevent the release of new virus particles from infected cells, hindering the spread of the virus. Notably, these drugs are effective against both influenza A and B viruses.\nWhile Zanamivir and Oseltamivir have proven to be valuable in influenza treatment, it’s important to acknowledge the presence of resistance, both in laboratory settings (in vitro) and in real-world scenarios (in vivo). The development of resistance highlights the ongoing challenge of managing influenza and the need for continued research and the development of new antiviral strategies.\n\n\n7.3.1.2 Vaccines\nVaccines are crucial tools in preventing and controlling the spread of influenza, but they require time for preparation. Traditionally, influenza vaccines have been developed based on the major circulating strains in a specific region. This involves predicting the most likely strains to be prevalent in the upcoming flu season.\nRegarding the use of RNA vaccines, there has been significant progress in recent years, and RNA-based influenza vaccines are being explored. These vaccines use genetic material, such as messenger RNA (mRNA), to stimulate an immune response against the virus. RNA vaccines offer certain advantages, including a faster production process compared to traditional methods.\nMost influenza vaccines are typically produced using eggs. The process involves growing the virus in eggs and then inactivating it to create the vaccine. However, this method has limitations, and newer technologies, such as cell-based and recombinant vaccine production, are being developed to overcome these challenges.\nReverse genetics has emerged as a valuable tool in the manufacture of influenza virus vaccines. This technique allows scientists to manipulate the genetic material of the virus, facilitating the development of vaccines with desired characteristics. Reverse genetics has contributed to advancements in vaccine production, including the creation of candidate vaccines that can be tailored to match circulating strains more precisely.\n\n7.3.1.2.1 During the 2009 H1N1 Outbreak\nVaccine production during the emergence of a new influenza virus, especially during a pandemic, poses challenges due to the limited time available to prepare sufficient vaccine stocks. A notable example is the pandemic of 2009, triggered by the emergence of a new influenza virus strain known as pH1N1/2009. The rapid emergence and global dissemination of this virus left little time to produce the necessary vaccine stocks to effectively combat the spread of the virus.\nIn response to the challenges posed by the pH1N1/2009 virus, alternative measures were employed to control its transmission. Antiviral drugs, such as Tamiflu, played a key role in managing and mitigating the impact of the pandemic. These drugs were used to treat infected individuals and help prevent further spread. Additionally, strategies such as virus detection and the quarantine of infected individuals were implemented to curb the transmission of the virus within communities.\nThe experience with the pH1N1/2009 pandemic underscored the importance of having multiple tools and strategies in place for the control of influenza viruses, especially when vaccine production may be constrained by time limitations during the early stages of a pandemic. Antiviral drugs, rapid detection methods, and effective public health measures remain crucial components of the response to emerging influenza viruses when timely vaccine production may not be feasible.\n\n\n\n\n7.3.2 Bird Transmissions\nTransmission by birds, especially aquatic birds, plays a significant role in the dynamics of influenza A viruses. All known subtypes of influenza A viruses have been identified in both domestic and wild aquatic birds. Among these birds, feral water birds, such as ducks and geese, are particularly noteworthy for hosting the largest number of influenza viruses.\nIn ducks, a substantial proportion of avian influenza strains replicate in the lungs and gastrointestinal tract. The virus is shed in nasal secretions and feces, contributing to its transmission. This shedding of the virus by infected birds becomes a key factor in the circulation of influenza A viruses. Ducks, being migratory waterfowl, play a crucial role in the continual circulation of influenza A viruses.\nThe natural reservoir of influenza A viruses in aquatic birds, combined with their migratory behaviors, creates an environment where these viruses can persist and spread. The ability of influenza A viruses to infect and be maintained in bird populations poses challenges for the prevention and control of avian influenza, especially considering the potential for the viruses to spill over into other species, including humans.\n\n7.3.2.1 In Birds?\nIn ducks, influenza A virus infection typically does not cause severe illness, rendering the infection avirulent in these birds. This unique characteristic allows ducks to serve as a natural reservoir for influenza A viruses. Despite being carriers of the virus, ducks often do not show significant signs of illness, enabling the virus to persist within their populations.\nHowever, the story changes when it comes to certain subtypes of the virus, specifically H5 and H7. In domestic poultry, these subtypes have the potential to produce systemic infections that can be far more severe. Systemic infection refers to the involvement of multiple organs and tissues throughout the body. In cases where domestic poultry, such as chickens or turkeys, are infected with H5 or H7 subtypes, high mortality rates can be associated with the infection.\nThe increased severity observed in domestic poultry contrasts with the avirulent nature of influenza A virus infection in ducks. This variation in the impact of different subtypes highlights the complexity of influenza viruses and the importance of understanding their behavior in different host species. It also underscores the potential risks associated with certain subtypes, especially those with the ability to cause systemic infection and higher mortality rates in domestic poultry.\n\n\n\n7.3.3 Swine Transmission\nSwine can play a role in the transmission of influenza viruses, being susceptible to infection with certain subtypes, notably H1N1 and H3N2. In swine populations, there are instances of classic swine influenza as well as viruses that are antigenically similar to those found in avian and human hosts.\nThe transmission of influenza from swine to humans has been demonstrated using serology techniques. This indicates that swine can serve as a source of influenza viruses that have the potential to infect humans. It’s important to note that H3N2 variants have been detected in pigs, and while these infections in pigs typically result in mild disease symptoms, the concern arises from the possibility of these viruses undergoing further changes and potentially causing infections in humans.\nThe ability of swine to be infected with influenza viruses from multiple sources, including avian and human viruses, adds to the complexity of influenza dynamics. This inter-species transmission can contribute to the emergence of novel influenza strains with the potential to infect humans. Monitoring and understanding influenza transmission in swine populations is crucial for assessing and mitigating the risks associated with the cross-species spread of influenza viruses.\n\n\n\n\n\nSwine Influenza Transmission\n\n\n\n\nIndeed, influenza variants with the potential to infect humans can emerge through reassortment events involving swine, avian, and human viruses. Swine are thought to act as a “mixing bowl” where different influenza viruses from various sources can undergo genetic reassortment.\nIn the close proximity of swine, which can be infected by both avian and human influenza viruses, the co-infection of these different strains provides an opportunity for their genetic material to mix and create novel virus variants. This reassortment can result in the emergence of influenza viruses with a combination of genetic elements from swine, avian, and human viruses.\nThe swine population’s ability to act as an intermediary host for influenza viruses from different sources underscores the importance of monitoring and understanding influenza dynamics in these animals. It also highlights the need for surveillance and control measures to prevent the emergence of novel influenza variants with the potential to cause infections in humans. The role of swine as a “mixing bowl” emphasizes the complex interactions between different influenza virus strains and the importance of addressing the risks associated with cross-species transmission.\n\n\n7.3.4 First Direct Transmission\nDirect transmission of avian influenza viruses to humans, without the involvement of an intermediate species like swine, was first reported in 1997. This transmission event involved the H5N1 subtype and occurred from infected poultry to humans. The H5N1 virus caused high mortality rates in both chickens (ranging from 70% to 100%) and humans (approximately 30%).\nKey features of the H5N1 virus in this instance included a polybasic sequence in the hemagglutinin (HA) protein and a shortened stalk region in the neuraminidase (NA) protein. Despite causing severe disease in humans, there was no evidence of human-to-human transmission on this occasion.\nThis occurrence highlighted that avian influenza viruses have the potential to be directly transmitted to humans, resulting in illness. However, for efficient human-to-human spread, additional changes in the virus, such as mutations or reassortment events, are typically required. The ability of avian influenza viruses to directly infect humans underscores the importance of vigilant surveillance and control measures to monitor and mitigate the risks associated with these viruses. Additionally, understanding the factors that contribute to the adaptation and transmission of avian influenza viruses in humans is crucial for public health preparedness."

    "section": "7.4 Host Adaptations",
    "text": "7.4 Host Adaptations\nHost adaptation in influenza viruses involves various aspects of the virus particle adapting to replicate effectively in a specific host. This process implies that interactions between the virus and the host occur in a species-specific manner, meaning the virus is tailored to exploit the cellular environment of a particular host species.\nThe adaptation process includes interactions between virus proteins and host cell proteins, and these interactions are often mediated by specific amino acid sequences. The virus must evolve to recognize and interact with host cell factors that facilitate its entry, replication, and exit from the host cell. For example, the virus might need to recognize and bind to specific cell surface receptors on the host cell to initiate the infection process.\nKey interactions occur between viral proteins, such as hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA), and host cell proteins. These interactions enable the virus to enter the host cell, replicate its genetic material, assemble new virus particles, and ultimately spread to infect other cells. The adaptation process often involves changes in these viral proteins that allow the virus to efficiently utilize the cellular machinery of the specific host species.\n\n7.4.1 Influenza Polymerase Complex\nThe influenza virus polymerase complex is a fundamental component responsible for orchestrating the replication and transcription of the viral genome. Comprising three essential proteins—PB1, PB2, and PA—each protein within this complex has distinct functions vital for the virus’s lifecycle. The PA protein contributes endonuclease activity, a critical function involved in cleaving host cell mRNA to initiate viral mRNA synthesis. Additionally, the C-terminal domain of PA serves as an interaction site with the PB1 protein, fostering cohesion within the polymerase complex.\nPB1, another key player, boasts polymerase activity essential for the synthesis of viral RNA. Its N-terminal region engages in a pivotal interaction with the PA protein, while the C-terminal region binds to the PB2 protein, fortifying the structural integrity of the complex. Moreover, PB1 directly binds to viral RNA, playing a crucial role in the initiation of viral RNA synthesis, a foundational step in the virus’s replication process.\nIn the intricate dance of the polymerase complex, the PB2 protein plays its part with a cap binding domain crucial for cap-snatching—a mechanism where the virus pilfers short fragments of capped RNA from host cell mRNA to prime viral mRNA synthesis. Additionally, PB2’s possession of a nuclear localization signal (NLS) guides the polymerase complex into the host cell nucleus, where the intricacies of viral replication and transcription unfold.\n\n7.4.1.1 mRNA Synthesis\n\n\n\n\n\nVirus Complex\n\n\n\n\nIn the context of mRNA synthesis during influenza virus replication, the polymerase complex plays a pivotal role and relies on the presence of viral RNA (vRNA) for activation. Within this complex, the PB1 subunit holds a critical function, housing the binding site for the 5’-terminal sequence of vRNA. The binding of this 5’-terminal sequence serves as a key activator, triggering the cap binding activity of the PB2 protein and initiating the PB1 binding activity at the 3’-terminal sequence of vRNA.\nThis sequential activation has a cascading effect on the polymerase complex’s functionality. The binding of the 3’-end of vRNA not only activates the cap binding activity of PB2 but also triggers an endonuclease activity in the PA protein. This endonuclease activity is essential for cleaving host cell mRNA, a crucial step in the cap-snatching process that provides primers for viral mRNA synthesis.\nUltimately, the nucleotide addition, a fundamental step in mRNA synthesis, is catalyzed by the PB1 protein. This orchestrated series of events highlights the intricate coordination within the influenza virus polymerase complex during mRNA synthesis. The interplay of these subunits and their activities showcases the adaptability of the virus in utilizing host cell machinery for its own replication, offering insights into potential targets for antiviral interventions.\n\n\n\n7.4.2 Cap Snatching\n\n\n\n\n\nCap Snatching\n\n\n\n\nCap snatching is a distinctive mechanism employed by influenza viruses during their replication cycle. Early studies demonstrated that the synthesis of viral mRNA is hindered by α-amanitin, an inhibitor targeting RNA polymerase II (RNA pol II), a key enzyme involved in transcribing cellular genes. This inhibition underscores the dependence of influenza virus replication on the host-cell nuclear machinery.\nIn the cap-snatching process, the virus hijacks host cell transcripts to acquire primers for the synthesis of its mRNA. Specifically, the primers are short capped RNA fragments denoted as m7 GpppXm, where X represents various nucleotides. These fragments are originally generated by the activity of RNA polymerase II in the host cell. The term “cap snatching” aptly describes this unique viral strategy, where the influenza virus seizes these capped fragments from host transcripts to kickstart its own mRNA synthesis.\nThis distinctive feature sets influenza apart from other viruses and showcases the virus’s ability to co-opt host cell components for its own replication. Understanding cap snatching provides insights into potential vulnerabilities in the viral life cycle and offers avenues for the development of antiviral strategies aimed at disrupting this specific mechanism.\n\n\n7.4.3 Host Protein Mutations\nHost adaptation of influenza virus P proteins, particularly mutations associated with avian-to-human adaptation, has been a subject of interest in influenza research. Notable mutations like E627K, T271A, E158G, and D701M have been identified in these proteins. While the molecular basis of these mutations in terms of species adaptation remains uncertain in general, some insights have been gleaned from specific cases.\nFor instance, the E627K mutation in the PB2 protein has been implicated in host adaptation. This mutation is thought to enable high replication rates at the lower temperatures typically found in human respiratory tracts compared to avian hosts. Additionally, changes in the sequence may influence interactions between the PB2 protein and the NP (nucleoprotein) protein, suggesting a potential mechanism for adaptation.\nFurthermore, the involvement of ANP32A, a host cellular protein, has been considered in the context of host adaptation. Sequence changes, such as those observed in the identified mutations, may confer differences in the interaction of influenza P proteins with cellular proteins, potentially influencing the virus’s ability to replicate and adapt to new host species.\nWhile the precise molecular mechanisms underlying these mutations and their roles in host adaptation are not fully elucidated, ongoing research aims to unravel the intricate interplay between viral proteins and host factors. Understanding these interactions is crucial for predicting and mitigating the risks associated with the emergence of influenza strains with increased potential for human transmission.\n\n\n\n\n\nPB2 Protein\n\n\n\n\nIndeed, other sequence changes in the PB2 protein of influenza virus have been implicated in interactions with host cellular components, particularly importins. One notable example is the D701M mutation in the PB2 protein. This mutation has been found to enhance the binding of the PB2 protein to mammalian importins.\nImportins are cellular proteins that play a crucial role in the transport of molecules, including viral proteins, into the nucleus of host cells. The D701M mutation appears to influence the efficiency and specificity of these interactions, potentially facilitating the transport of viral components into the nucleus of mammalian cells more effectively.\n\n\n7.4.4 Receptor Usage\nThe receptor usage of influenza viruses is a crucial factor in determining their ability to infect different species. Human influenza viruses, particularly H3 strains, predominantly use sialyoliogosaccharides terminated by α2,6 galactose for binding, whereas avian influenza viruses favor binding to α2,3 galactose.\nThis receptor specificity is dictated by the structure of the hemagglutinin (HA) binding pocket, a viral protein that plays a key role in the initial stages of viral entry into host cells. Avian intestines primarily contain α2,3 linkages, pig trachea features both α2,3 and α2,6 linkages, and human trachea predominantly has α2,6 linkages. This structural variation in sialic acid linkages acts as a determinant for the specificity of the virus, influencing its ability to transfer between different species.\nFor example, the preference for α2,3 linkages in avian viruses serves as a restriction for direct transmission to humans, as human respiratory tissues predominantly feature α2,6 linkages. Pigs, however, play a unique role as potential intermediate hosts, as they possess both human (α2,6 galactose) and avian (α2,3 galactose) receptors. This characteristic makes swine a significant host in the interspecies transmission of influenza viruses, potentially facilitating the adaptation of avian viruses to human hosts. Understanding these receptor-specific interactions is crucial for predicting and monitoring the emergence of influenza strains with pandemic potential.\n\n\n7.4.5 Activating HA Protein\n\n\n\n\n\nCleavage Sites of the HA Protein\n\n\n\n\nThe hemagglutinin (HA) protein is a central player in the pathogenicity of influenza viruses. Its activation is a crucial step, involving protease cleavage that transforms the precursor form (HA0) into the mature protein consisting of HA1 and HA2 subunits.\nThe cleavage site of HA is notable for its basic residues, and this feature plays a significant role in determining the activation process. There are two main types of cleavage sites based on the number of basic residues present:\n\nPolybasic Sequence (4-6 basic residues): This type of cleavage site is cleaved by enzymes such as furin and furin-like enzymes, which are expressed in various cell types. The presence of these enzymes in a wide range of cells contributes to the broad tissue tropism of influenza viruses. The cleavage by furin-like enzymes is associated with a higher pathogenic potential.\nSingle/Few Basic Residue: In this case, cleavage occurs through specific proteases found in particular cell types. For example, the Clara protease is a specific protease found in specialized respiratory cells. The specificity of cleavage in certain cell types can influence the tissue tropism and pathogenicity of the virus.\n\nThe nature of the cleavage site is a key determinant in the classification of influenza viruses as avirulent or virulent. Viruses with a polybasic cleavage site are often associated with increased pathogenicity, as they can be cleaved by a broader range of host enzymes, allowing for more efficient viral replication and spread. Understanding the nuances of HA proteolytic activation provides insights into the factors influencing the pathogenic potential of influenza viruses."

On one hand, electron microscopes can magnify and show a lot of tiny details, but there’s a downside to this: the microscope works in a vacuum - a space without air - so samples need to be dry.\nScientists use these techniques to see things up close using special labels. They attach tiny gold particles to antibodies, and these antibodies can be seen under the microscope and identify specific parts in the samples that they’re looking at.\n\n8.2.1 Scanning Electron Microscopy (i.e., SEM)\n\n\n\n\n\nExamples of Samples Viewed using Scanning Electron Microscopy\n\n\n\n\nScanning electron microscopy (i.e., SEM) is a method used to look at the outside of cells or bigger parts like viruses. Cells are first treated with something called critical point drying to make sure that they’re ready for the microscope.\n\n\n\n\n\nOutline of How SEM Works\n\n\n\n\nThe above figure outlines how SEM typically works:\n\nFixation\nScientist ensure that the cells or samples are fixed. This is almost like taking a picture to ensure that everything stays still.\nDrying\nWater is removed from the samples. Water can mess up the microscope.\nCritical Point Drying\nThis is akin to freeze-drying, but is a technique that helps keep the samples in a good shape for the microscope.\nCoating\nThe sample is coated with a thin layer of a special material - usually metal - to make the samples stronger and ready for the microscope.\nSEM Analysis\nThe sample is put into a SEM - this microscope uses special light to take a super close-up picture of the samples. Scientists can then study these pictures to know more about what it is that they’re looking at.\n\n\n\n8.2.2 Transmission Electron Microscopy (i.e., TEM)\n\n8.2.2.1 Negative Staining\nNegative staining is a way to look at virus particles, their morphology, and detect viruses in clinical material. In this setup, special heavy metals make the virus parts stand out more. Uranyl acetate and phosphotungstic acid are two common choices; these agents don’t color the virus, but they make them easier to see under an electron microscope.\nScientists also use a special grid to look at the viruses under the electron microscope.\n\n\n\n\n\nOutline of How TEM Works\n\n\n\n\nThe above figure outlines how TEM works:\n\nAdding Sample to Buffer\nSamples are added to a special liquid called a buffer - this helps keep sample safe and ready for the following step.\nAdding Heavy Metal Stain\nA special “paint” made out of heavy metals is added to the sample - this helps the microscope see the sample better by giving it strong contrasts (i.e., like dark ink on white paper).\nBlotting\nThe sample is put onto a special surface that soaks up the extra liquid.\nAir Drying\nThe sample is left in the air to dry. This helps the heavy metal paint to stick to the sample and make it ready for viewing.\n\n\n\n8.2.2.2 Immuno-Negative Staining\nWhen negative staining is performed with immunolabelling, this is called immuno-negative staining. First, immunolabelling - putting special “labels” on the objects of interests - is carried out. Then, negative staining is carried out to make the sample easier to look at.\n\n\n8.2.2.3 Thin Sections\nTo study samples closely, scientists need to prepare them carefully:\n\nFirst, they make the cells stay still using a process called fixation.\nThey treat the cells with chemicals and then remove water from them.\nThey put the cells into a special plastic material to keep them in shape. To see virus-infected cells, they need to cut super thin slices, like cutting very thin pieces of cheese. These slices are usually between 80 and 100 nanometers thick.\nThey use a special machine called an ultramicrotome to do this cutting. Once the slices are ready, they put them on a small grid and add some coloring to help see the details better when they use the electron microscope.\n\nSamples can also be immunolabelled before or after embedding (i.e., keeping the cells into a special plastic material) and sectioning."

    "section": "9.1 Cultivating Viruses",
    "text": "9.1 Cultivating Viruses\nThree people - John Enders, Thomas Weller, and Frederick Robbins - were able to grow poliovirus particles in human cells.\nWhen it comes to growing viruses, scientists use different types of cell systems:\n\nPrimary Cells\nThese are directly taken from tissues and not repeatedly grown in culture. These cells, like chick embryo fibroblasts (CEF), closely resemble the original tissue, but their preparation can be complex and requires tissue access.\nCell Lines\nThese are cells that have been made immortal through processes like transformation, as seen in Vero cells and MDCK cells. While they are easy to maintain, they might lose some characteristics of the original tissue.\nAnimal Tissues or Structures\nThis may involve tissues or structures from animals, such as using suckling mouse brain for flaviviruses or embryonated eggs for influenza.\n\nThe choice of cell system depends on the virus being studied; for example, MDCK cells are preferred for growing influenza viruses.\nTo gather viruses from an infected host, scientists can collect substances like excretions, secretions, blood, or tissue, and then use these materials to infect cell cultures. The virus obtained from this process is known as a virus isolate.\nSometimes, viruses change to grow better in specific cell lines, leading to genetic modifications associated with adapting to cell cultures. This can be problematic for researchers wanting to study the virus in its natural form (undesirable), but it’s also useful for developing weakened virus vaccines (desirable) since it forms the foundation for making attenuated viral vaccines.\n\n9.1.1 Cytopathic Effect\n\n\n\n\n\nExample of the Cytopathic Effect\n\n\n\n\nWhen viruses infect cultured cells, they can cause different visual changes in the cells’ appearance. These changes are collectively called cytopathic effect or “CPE”. The specific type of CPE can vary depending on the virus and the type of cell it infects.\n\n\n9.1.2 Particle / PFU Ratio\nThe particle or pfu ratio is a comparison between the total number of virus particles and the number of infectious particles, usually measured in plaque forming units (i.e., pfu). In an ideal scenario, this ratio would be 1.0, indicating that all particles are infectious.\nHowever, in real-world situations, this ratio is typically greater than 1.0. For instance, with influenza, this ratio can be around 10, suggesting that not all virus particles are capable of causing infection.\n\n\n9.1.3 Multiplicity of Infection (i.e., MOI)\nThe Multiplicity of Infection (i.e., moi) measures the average amount of infectious virus introduced to each cell. For instance, an moi of 1 means adding 1 pfu per cell. It’s important to determine this for a specific virus stock preparation.\nTo create a virus stock, a low moi is used, usually ranging from 0.01 to 0.1. This helps prevent the creation of defective interfering particles, which would increase the particle/pfu ratio.\nOn the other hand, studies focusing on virus replication use a higher moi, typically between 5 and 10, ensuring that all cells are infected simultaneously. To calculate moi accurately, it’s necessary to know both the cell count and the number of infectious particles being added."

    "section": "9.2 Quantifying Viruses",
    "text": "9.2 Quantifying Viruses\nThere are two main types of assays used to study viruses:\n\nInfectivity assays\nThese tests are designed to measure the presence of infectious virus particles. They determine whether the virus is capable of infecting and replicating within host cells.\nNon-infectivity assays\nThese assays are used to measure the quantity of virus present in a sample, regardless of whether the virus is still capable of causing infection. They provide information about the overall amount of viral material in the sample.\n\n\n9.2.1 Virus Infectivity Assays\n\n9.2.1.1 Plaque Assay\n\n\n\n\n\nResults from a Plaque Assay\n\n\n\n\nThe plaque assay is a technique that exploits the fact that a single infectious virus particle can cause a visible area of damage, like cell death. Here’s how it works:\n\nScientists create serial dilutions of a virus suspension and apply these dilutions to a layer of cells. The cells are then incubated for a specific period, which varies depending on the virus.\nAn overlay is added to the cell layer to restrict the spread of the virus, allowing local virus replication to occur.\nAfter some time, the cells are stained so that the areas of damage, called plaques, become visible to the naked eye.\nEach plaque originates from a single infectious virus particle. This helps researchers count the number of infectious particles in the initial virus suspension.\nDifferent types of cells are used for different viruses. For example, MDCK cells are used for influenza, and HEp2 cells are used for RSV. This is because different viruses interact better with specific cell types.\n\nIn essence, the plaque assay is a method for quantifying the number of infectious virus particles in a sample and allows researchers to study their effects on cells.\nThe plaque assay method can be adapted in various ways to suit specific needs:\n\nDifferent overlay medium\nInstead of using the standard overlay, various substances like agarose, carboxymethyl cellulose (cmc), or avecel can be used. These substances modify how the virus spreads and affects cells.\nDifferent visualization methods for plaques\nPlaques, the visible areas of cell damage, can be detected in diverse ways. This could involve visual observation (noting cell death) or using immunostaining techniques to identify specific viral proteins or markers associated with infected cells. These variations allow researchers to tailor the assay to their objectives and the characteristics of the virus being studied.\n\n\n\n9.2.1.2 Endpoint Assay\nThe endpoint assay is employed when certain viruses don’t create plaques or foci but instead lead to noticeable cytopathic effects (CPE), such as the measles virus on Vero cells.\nHere’s how the endpoint assay works:\n\nReplicates and TCID50\nMultiple repetitions of the assay are conducted using different virus dilutions. The dilution at which 50% of these replicates show CPE is determined. This provides a value known as the TCID50 (50% Tissue Culture Infectious Dose).\nReed and Muench calculation\nTo calculate TCID50, the Reed and Muench method is commonly employed. This involves statistical calculations to estimate the viral concentration based on the observed outcomes in the replicates.\n\nThe endpoint assay is an alternate method for quantifying viral infectivity when plaque formation isn’t applicable. It helps researchers gauge the virus’s impact on cell cultures.\n\n\n\n9.2.2 Other Assays\n\n9.2.2.1 Haemagglutination Assay\n\n\n\n\n\nSchematic of a Haemagglutination Assay\n\n\n\n\nBack in 1941, George Hirst made a significant breakthrough by showing that the influenza virus could clump together red blood cells.\nThis discovery introduced the first quick and quantitative technique for measuring viruses that affect eukaryotic cells. For the first time, it became possible to actually count viruses. This method, which measures the level of influenza virus, is still in use today.\n\n\n9.2.2.2 Direct Particle Count\n\n\n\n\n\nIllustration of a Direct Particle Count\n\n\n\n\nThe direct particle count method involves estimating the quantity of virus particles using electron microscopy. Here’s how it works:\n\nUsing visible markers\nScientists incorporate a known concentration of easily visible markers, like latex beads, into the virus sample.\nElectron microscopy\nThe sample is then examined under an electron microscope, allowing researchers to observe and count both the virus particles and the added markers.\n\nHowever, it’s important to note that this method doesn’t differentiate between infectious and noninfectious virus particles. While it provides a measure of the total number of particles, it doesn’t offer insights into their infectivity."

    "text": "10.1 Reverse Genetics\nSometimes, scientists want to understand how certain changes in viruses can affect their behavior. It’s like studying what happens when you change some parts of a toy.\nTo do this, they aim to create a sort of “genetic blueprint” for the virus, a bit like having a recipe that can make the virus. This blueprint is made of DNA and allows them to generate a virus that can actually infect cells and do its thing.\nFor viruses with positive-strand RNA, it’s quite direct. It’s like having a simple recipe that’s easy to follow.\nHowever, for viruses with negative-strand RNA or other complex types, things get tricky. It’s like having a tricky recipe that’s not easy to understand. Scientists need to figure out ways to work with these viruses, and sometimes it’s quite complicated. In fact, for some viruses, there aren’t even good methods yet.\n\n10.1.1 Genetic Recombination from Cloned DNA\n\n10.1.1.1 Positive Stranded Viruses\n\n\n\n\n\nOverview of Replication Strategy of Positive Stranded Viruses\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10.1.1.2 Negative Stranded Viruses\n\n\n\n\n\nOverview of Replication Strategy of Negative Stranded Viruses\n\n\n\n\nSome examples of generating negative stranded RNA viruses via reverse genetics include:\n\nParamyxovirus\nTo get the virus working, it’s like having a team of players. The main players are L (polymerase), P (cofactor), and N (vRNA binder), and they need to work together to do their job.\nTo make this happen, scientists put together a special setup. It’s like gathering the right players for a game. They put bits of genetic instructions for L, P, and N into the cell, just like sending in players to play their roles (i.e., plasmids containing L, P, and N). They also add in the virus’s complete instructions.\nImagine it’s like getting the team’s players and the playbook ready to start the game.\nInfluenza Virus\n\n\n\n\n\nAppearance of a Flu Virus\n\n\n\n\nImagine the Influenza virus as a set of building blocks, but instead of having all the instructions on one block, they spread them out on different blocks. It’s like having different pages of a recipe in separate books.\nIn the case of the Influenza A virus, it’s like having 8 different books, each with its own set of instructions for making different parts of the virus.\nTo build the virus, certain blocks have special jobs. Think of these blocks as the leaders of the construction team. There are four blocks named NP, PB1, PB2, and PA. These four work together like a powerful team to make the virus’s “building crew,” kind of like a mastermind group.\n\n\n\n\n10.1.2 12 Plasmid System\n\n\n\n\n\n12 Plasmid System\n\n\n\n\nWhen scientists want to make a virus do something, it’s like giving it a job to perform. They use special “worker molecules” called RNA pol1 or pol2, kind of like having different teams for different tasks.\nNow, here comes an interesting point. Imagine the virus’s instructions are like puzzle pieces. For some viruses with many pieces (segments), scientists need more instruction cards (plasmids) to complete the puzzle. Think of it like needing more recipe cards to make a big meal.\nCurrently, for some viruses, scientists need around 12 or 8 of these special cards (i.e., plasmids) to make the virus work properly. It’s like needing a lot of recipe cards to make a complex dish.\n\n\n10.1.3 Applications\nUsually, flu vaccines are made using eggs. It’s like using eggs as tiny factories to create the vaccine.\nBut there’s a challenge. The H5N1 virus is a bit tricky. It’s really strong and can cause problems in the labs where it’s grown, which is like a high-security zone. Because it’s so strong, it even harms the eggs used to grow it, like breaking the eggs you want to use for cooking.\nBecause of this, the amount of virus that can be grown is limited. It’s like not having enough ingredients to make a big batch of food.\n\n\n\n\n\n12 Plasmid System to Generate H5N1 Virus Particles\n\n\n\n\nWhen there’s a tricky virus like H5N1 that’s causing problems, scientists use reverse genetics. It’s like solving a puzzle backwards.\nThey create a new virus that’s safe and not very risky. This new virus can also grow well in eggs, like the ones they use for making vaccines."

It helps us understand how contagious a disease is.\nImagine there’s a new disease, and nobody has been exposed to it before. The R number tells us how many new cases we can expect from just one infected person.\nHere’s the deal: If the R number is 2, it means that one sick person is likely to pass the disease to two other people. And then those two people can each pass it to two more, and so on. The R number helps us see how fast a disease can spread.\nBut, this number assumes that no one is already immune to the disease and that nobody has been vaccinated. In the real world, things are a bit more complicated, but the R number gives us a starting point to understand how easily a disease can jump from person to person."

    "text": "11.2 Modes of Virus Transmission\n\n\n\n\n\nSeveral Modes of Transmission of Viruses\n\n\n\n\nThe above figure shows how viruses can spread from one human (i.e., host) to another - for instance, through the air, the fecal-oral (i.e., from contaminated poop), and vice versa.\n\n11.2.1 Respiratory Route\n\n\n\n\n\nExample of Respiratory Transmission\n\n\n\n\nYou know when someone sneezes, and you see those little water droplets in the air? Those are like tiny vehicles for germs. If you’re close to someone who’s sick and they sneeze, those droplets might carry the flu virus, and if you breathe them in, you can get sick too.\nIn 2018, there were a lot of people around the world who got sick with the flu, and sadly, many of them passed away. The World Health Organization reported up to 646,000 deaths from the flu.\n\n\n11.2.2 Fomites\n\n\n\n\n\nExamples of Fomites\n\n\n\n\nFomites are just things like surfaces and objects. Sometimes, when people are sick, they can leave tiny drops of their respiratory secretions (like from coughing or sneezing) on these surfaces.\nIf a person touches these contaminated surfaces, they can pick up those germs on their hands. And if they touch their face, like their mouth or nose, those germs can get inside their body, making them sick too.\nA couple of diseases, like SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) and RSV (Respiratory Syncytial Virus), can spread this way. It’s not as far-reaching as aerosols (those tiny droplets in the air), so it usually affects people who are in closer contact with each other or who touch the same things.\n\n\n11.2.3 Blood\n\n\n\n\n\nDisease Transmission Through Blood\n\n\n\n\nTwo examples are HBV (Hepatitis B) and HCV (Hepatitis C). These diseases can be spread through blood in a few different ways.\nOne way is through blood transfusion. Sometimes, people need to receive blood from donors, like during surgeries or if they have certain medical conditions. If the blood they receive is infected with HBV or HCV, it can make them sick.\nAnother way is through contaminated blood products. Sometimes, people with specific medical conditions need treatments that use blood products. If these products aren’t screened and tested for diseases like HBV and HCV, they can end up causing infections.\n\n\n11.2.4 Fecal Oral Route\nThere are different ways through which some viruses can make people sick, and we can break these down into a few categories. One way is by eating contaminated food. For example, hepatitis A can be found in shellfish. If these shellfish are not properly cleaned or cooked, the virus can get into our bodies when we eat them.\nAnother way is by ingesting contaminated water. This means drinking water that’s been polluted, often with sewage. The polio virus is one example of a virus that can spread through contaminated water.\nViruses can also spread through direct contact with infected people or by touching things they’ve touched. For instance, when we shake hands with someone who has a virus, we might pick it up. This can also happen when we touch things that are contaminated with viruses, like doorknobs or surfaces. The Norwalk virus is one that can spread this way.\nAnd when it comes to the “CRAP” viruses, it’s an easy way to remember four groups of viruses that can make us sick: C for Calicivirus (like Norwalk), R for Rotavirus, A for Adenovirus, and P for Picornavirus (which includes viruses like Hepatitis A and Poliovirus).\nFinally, using shared needles for things like drug use can also spread these diseases. When people share needles, there’s a risk that they can accidentally inject themselves with blood from someone else who’s infected.\n\n\n\n\n\nStatistics Pertaining to the Rotavirus\n\n\n\n\nThe thing about Enteroviruses is that they cause about 215000 deaths in children per year (which is about 3.14% of all child deaths across the globe).\n\n\n11.2.5 Veneral\nThis just refers to sex (i.e., unprotected sex). Interestingly enough, there’s evidence to suggest that although the Zika virus is generally spread through mosquitos, that it can also spread via sex."

    "section": "11.3 Modes of Transmission",
    "text": "11.3 Modes of Transmission\nZoonosis is a term used to describe how viruses can be passed from animals to humans. This can happen in several ways and involve many different animals. Sometimes, the transmission occurs directly from animals to humans, like when we’re in close contact with them. Other times, it’s indirect, and we might get the virus through something that came from animals, like their meat or other products.\nWhen it comes to zoonotic viruses, they often have a close connection to specific animals. This means that a particular virus is usually passed from a certain animal to humans. In some cases, insects play a role in this transmission. For instance, the Aedes mosquito can carry viruses like dengue and yellow fever. Ticks are another example and can transmit viruses like Tick-borne encephalitis. Even tiny creatures like Culicoides, often called midges, can be involved in spreading viruses such as the Blue tongue virus. Sand flies are culprits too, transmitting viruses like Chandipura.\nIt’s not just insects; other animals also play a role. Wild animals, like dogs, can transmit the rabies virus. Even animals we’re more familiar with, like chickens, can be carriers of zoonotic viruses. Chickens, for instance, can carry the avian H5N1 influenza virus. So, zoonotic viruses have various paths to reach humans, and specific animals are often part of this transmission process.\n\n11.3.1 Arboviruses\nSome viruses are quite crafty and employ insects as their messengers, spreading infections. These are called Arboviruses, and a couple of examples include dengue and yellow fever viruses. Here’s how it works: these viruses make themselves at home inside insects. After an insect feeds on an infected host (like a human or animal), the virus multiplies inside the insect. Then, when the insect bites another host (like another human), it transfers the virus along with its saliva.\nThe virus gets into the new host’s body at the bite site and starts multiplying there. After a bit of replication at the bite site, it moves into the bloodstream and travels around the body. It can infect various organs and tissues, depending on the virus. For instance, yellow fever virus often sets up shop in the liver tissue. So, these arboviruses have a pretty complex journey, involving both insects and humans or animals to spread their infections.\n\n\n\n\n\nUrban and Jungle Cycle of the Yellow Fever Virus\n\n\n\n\nThe Yellow Fever Virus (i.e., YFV) also spreads two ways: the urban and the jungle cycle.\n\n\n11.3.2 Indirect versus Direct Transmission\n\n\n\n\n\nExamples of Indirect and Direct Transmission\n\n\n\n\nVirus transmission can happen through direct or indirect means. In direct transmission, the virus goes directly from one host to another, like when a person gets infected from handling infected chickens with avian H5N1 virus.\nIndirect transmission is a bit more complicated. It might involve an intermediate species, which acts as a middleman for the virus. For instance, a virus could go from a bat to a primate, and then from that primate to a human. So, in this case, it takes a little detour through an intermediate host before reaching the final destination, which is the human"

    "text": "11.4 Route of Entry and Tissue Tropism\nWhen a virus enters a host, the initial cells it infects depend on how it enters the body. This is like the virus’s first point of contact with the host.\nAfter the virus enters the body, there’s a waiting period called the incubation period. During this time, the virus multiplies, creating more of itself. This is an important step for the virus to establish an infection. It’s like the virus needs to build an army before it can start causing trouble.\n\n\n\n\n\nVirus Amounts Over Time\n\n\n\n\nThe virus might move from where it initially entered to a specific organ or tissue in the body. It’s like the virus is traveling to its favorite vacation spot inside the host. It can use different methods to do this, like hitching a ride through the bloodstream (which is called viremia) or even traveling through the nervous system.\nAll these movements and replications take time, and this whole process leads to the onset of disease symptoms. How soon these symptoms show up depends on which organ or tissue the virus has infected. When the symptoms appear, it’s usually when the immune system is working at its maximum level, trying to fight off the virus.\n\n11.4.1 Acute versus Chronic Infections\nWhen you have an acute infection, it means you get sick, but it doesn’t last very long. The symptoms come and go relatively quickly, and your body manages to clear the virus. Sometimes you recover completely, like when you catch a common cold (rhinovirus). But in more severe cases, it can lead to death, as seen with the highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAI H5N1).\nOn the other hand, chronic infection means the symptoms and the virus stick around in your body for a long time. You don’t get better quickly. Some examples are hepatitis B and HIV-1. In these cases, the virus can stay with you for years, and it’s harder for your body to get rid of it. It’s like having a persistent guest that doesn’t want to leave.\nWhether someone recovers from an infection or doesn’t make it (death) affects how the virus can spread to others.\nIf someone gets better, it’s less likely they’ll pass the virus to someone else. They might not be contagious anymore.\nBut if the person doesn’t make it (dies), the virus could still infect others. It depends on the virus and how it spreads."

It’s like keeping infected individuals away from healthy people.\nWhere you quarantine someone depends on how the virus behaves:\n\nSometimes, people can stay at home, and it’s called self-home quarantine. This works well for illnesses like seasonal flu.\nBut for really dangerous or new viruses with high death rates, like SARS, special facilities are used. These places are designed to keep the virus from getting out and infecting more people.\n\nIn both cases, the goal is to prevent the virus from going to new people and slow down the disease’s spread.\nFinding infected people, especially when we’re dealing with a new virus and might not have many tests, can be really tricky, especially at places like airports. Imagine trying to test everyone; it’s just not practical.\n\n\n\n\n\nExample of a Heatmap in an Airport Setting\n\n\n\n\nOne way to tackle this problem is by using a strategy that’s a bit like a heat map. Instead of testing everyone, we can look at a lot of information, like who’s traveling from places where the virus is common, and who’s showing signs of illness. Then we can focus our testing efforts on those who seem more likely to be infected.\nThis way, we’re trying to be smart about where we look for infections and not waste resources testing everyone.\n\n11.5.1 Drugs and Quarantine\nImagine you have a new vaccine to protect people from a disease, but you can’t give it to everyone. So what do you do? You use a strategy called ring vaccination. Here’s how it works.\nFirst, you find someone who’s sick with the disease, let’s say it’s a new virus. You then trace back to see who this sick person has been in close contact with – family, friends, people they work with, and so on.\n\n\n\n\n\nIllustration of Ring Immunity\n\n\n\n\nThen, you vaccinate those close contacts. This way, if any of them were already infected but didn’t show symptoms yet, the vaccine can help stop them from spreading the virus to others.\nBut, sometimes it’s hard to trace all those contacts, especially if the virus is spreading quickly. In that case, instead of tracing contacts, you might decide to just vaccinate everyone in the area where the disease is spreading. This way, you’re covering a larger group to stop the virus in its tracks.\nSo, ring vaccination is like creating a protective ring around the disease, trying to keep it from spreading any further. It’s a smart way to use vaccines to stop outbreaks.\n\n\n11.5.2 Antivirus Drugs\nSo, what if we don’t have a vaccine for a disease, like during a fast-spreading flu pandemic? In this case, we can turn to antiviral drugs. These are special medications that can help slow down how quickly the virus spreads.\nImagine there’s a new flu virus that’s making a lot of people sick, and we don’t have a vaccine for it yet. But we do have antiviral drugs like Tamiflu. We can use these drugs to reduce how many people get infected.\nOne way to use them is by giving the antiviral drugs to people who are most likely to catch the virus. For example, healthcare workers who are in close contact with sick patients.\nHowever, there’s a catch. Viruses can sometimes change and become resistant to these drugs. It’s a bit like how some bacteria can become resistant to antibiotics. So, while antiviral drugs can help in a pandemic, we need to be careful about not overusing them.\n\n\n11.5.3 Swiss Cheese Model\n\n\n\n\n\nIllustration of the Swiss Cheese Model\n\n\n\n\nThink of controlling a virus like protecting a piece of cheese. There’s no single method that can block the virus completely. So, we use a bunch of different measures, like slices of Swiss cheese, to protect ourselves.\nEach slice represents a different way to stop the virus from spreading. Some slices might be personal things like wearing masks, washing your hands, and staying home when you’re sick. Other slices are shared, like testing and tracing to find out who’s infected and quarantine to keep them isolated.\nThe idea is that when you stack all these slices together, it becomes really hard for the virus to slip through the holes in the cheese. So, even if one layer has some gaps, the other layers help block the virus."
