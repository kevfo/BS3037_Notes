    "section": "1.2 What is a Virus?",
    "text": "1.2 What is a Virus?\nViruses were originally said to be tiny objects that can pass through filters (unlike bacteria), but nonetheless, a virus is a tiny particle that has genetic material, a protein shell, and sometimes, a fatty covering.\nViruses can be differerently complex in terms of their genetic or molecular makeup, but their genomes don’t encode for a lot of proteins.\nThat said, viruses must utilize host cell machinery to survive - they also maintain close contact with cells. So, scientists need to grow viruses in cells to study them. All viruses also follow certain steps (see below) to make copies of themselves - these steps are similar for all viruses.\n\n1.2.1 Stages of Virus Replication\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneral Schematic of How Viruses Replicate Using a Paramyxovirus\n\n\n\n\nThe basic stages (using the paramyxovirus) include:\n\nAttachment and Entry Uncoating\nViruses stick to cells to get in them. They then release their genetic material when they’re inside the cell.\nReplication and Transcription\nThe virus’ genetic material takes over the cell’s machinery to make new genetic material and proteins. This creates more virus parts.\nAssembly\nThe genetic material and proteins form new virus particles.\nRelease\nThe virus particles break free from the cell and infect other cells. Everything repeats itself.\n\n\n\n1.2.2 Virus Classification\nThe taxonomic method used to group viruses is polythetic - a virus group is described by its properties. Some properties used to describe viruses include:\n\nMorphology\nThis refers to the virus’ size, shape, capsid symmetry, and whether it has an envelope or not.\n\n\n\n\n\nViruses at Different Sizes\n\n\n\n\nHow big a virus is affects the way it interacts with its host.\nPhysical Properties\nThis refers to the virus’ genome, its response to physical and / or chemical agents, and its antigenic properties.\nBiological Properties\nThis refers to the virus’ replication methods, hosts, transmission modes, and also how infectious it is.\n\nThoguh, the following metrics can be used as well:\n\nGenetic Material\nViruses can also contain RNA instead of DNA.\nGenome Structure\nThey can be single or multiple-copied, single or double stranded (i.e., “ss” or “ds”), and have various orientations (i.e., +ve like mRNA or -ve sense).\nEnveloped or Non-Enveloped Status\nViruses can come with or without lipid envelopes. For those without envelopes, they have a capsid structure and have Icosahedral symmetry (i.e., two, three, and five-fold symmetry).\n\n\n\n\n\nA Virus with a Lipid Envelope\n\n\n\n\nViruses that have envelopes have something called a lipid bilayer surrounding them. Spike proteins - “little arms” that stick out from the bilayer are usually found too; the arms can help the virus anchor onto surfaces.\n\n\n\n1.2.3 Virus Taxonomy\nScientists who study viruses use a system by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (i.e., ICTV) to organize and name them. The system starts with the biggest group “order” before going down to more specific sub-levels (i.e., “class”, “order”, “family”, etc). There are also special rules for naming and writing descriptions for viruses.\nFor instance, the human respiratory syncytial virus (i.e., RSV) can be classified using this system as:\n\nIt’s in the “Mononegavirales” order\nIt’s in the “Paramyxoviridae” family\nIt’s in the “Pneumovirinae” subfamily\nIt’s in the “Pneumovirus” genus\nIt’s called “Human respiratory syncytial virus” as a species\n\nScientists also tell viruses apart by looking at their genetic sequences. For instance, there’s a type of RSV called “RSV A2” and another called “RSV Long Isolates”."

    "text": "1.3 Where Do Viruses Come From?\nScientist think that there are 1031 viruses on the planet; there are also a lot of viruses in the ocean (i.e., about 1.3 \\(\\times\\) 1028 viruses).\nViruses infect about 1023 entities per second in the ocean, and these infections remove about 20% to 40% of oceanic bacteria each day. The amount of bacteria in the human stomach is weighs about a kilogram and the average human adult will poop their own weight in bacteria each year. 8% of viral DNA also comes from what is left of viral genomes.\nThere are about 1400 types of disease-causing organisms that affect humans, for instance, fungi, bacteria, viruses, and more. Yet, these organisms also make up less than a percent of all the microbes on Earth. Scientists think that there could be 120000 to millions of different microbe species in total and that we’ve only studied an incredibly small portion of DNA on Earth1.\n\n1.3.1 Natural Reservoirs of Human Infection\n\n\n\n\n\nSome Examples of Virus Reservoirs\n\n\n\n\nViruses can live inside hosts. An infection happens when the virus jumps ship from a host to another person who isn’t infected. The source of virus infections is a significant factor in controlling diseases."

    "text": "1.4 What Does the Future Hold?\n\n\n\n\n\nPolio Hieroglyphs from Ancient Egypt\n\n\n\n\nExperts think that the first ever record of a viral infection was in a hieroglyph from Memphis - ancient Egypt’s capital - from about 3700 BCE. In this hieroglyph, Ruma - a temple priest - is showing signs of paralytic poliomyelitis.\n\n\n\n\n\nSmallpox on an Egyptian Mummy\n\n\n\n\nThere’s also reason to believe that a smallpox outbreak happened in Ancient Egypt, 1157 BC. There’s evidence of smallpox on Ramses V’s mummy.\n\n1.4.1 First Steps to Understanding Viruses\nApproaches have been devised in the past to deal with viruses and other infectious diseases:\n\nVariolation\n\n\n\n\n\nAn Ancient Chinese Physician Variolating a Person\n\n\n\n\nThe ancient Chinese inhaled dried scabs from smallpox survivors while the Turks and the Europeans used pus from a lesion. This was based on the observation that smallpox survivors were immune to subsequent smallpox infections.\nVaccination\n\n\n\n\n\nEdward Jenner Vaccinating a Young Boy Against Smallpox\n\n\n\n\nEdward Jenner noticed that milkmaids who contracted cowpox - a milder variant of smallpox - do not contract smallpox.\nSo, he suggestd infecting people with cowpox to make someone immune against smallpox. Jenner would then go ahead and infect a young boy with cowpox lesions; he would then go ahead and expose the boy to smallpox a couple of days later.\nAlthough his work was initially met with ridicule, it was eventually met with acceptance.\nFurther Attempts\nBack in 1892, a scientist named Dmitri Iwanowski found that something from sick tobacco plants could make healthy plants sick too. This “something” could pass through filters that catch small things.\nThen, in 1898, Freidrich Loeffler and Paul Frosch discovered that a similar tiny thing caused foot-and-mouth disease in cattle. So these things weren’t just affecting plants, they were causing problems in animals too.\nLater, in 1908, Karl Landsteiner and Erwin Popper showed that poliomyelitis, a disease that affects the nerves, was also caused by one of these tiny things. This was the first time we realized that viruses could infect not only animals but humans as well.\n\nIn 1915, a scientist named Frederick Twort was the first to notice viruses that can infect bacteria\n\n\n1.4.2 Beginning of Molecular Virology\nIn 1977, Frederick Sanger and his team figured out the whole order of 5,375 building blocks (nucleotides) in the genome of a virus called bacteriophage fX174. This was a big deal and they even won the Nobel Prize in 1980 for it. This was the very first time anyone had completely figured out the order of all the parts in a living thing’s genome.\nThen, in 1983, scientists Luc Montagnier and Robert Gallo made a huge announcement. They found a virus named human immunodeficiency virus (i.e., HIV) which causes AIDS. This happened just two years after AIDS started spreading, so it was a quick discovery."
