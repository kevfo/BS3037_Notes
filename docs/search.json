    "section": "1.2 What is a Virus?",
    "text": "1.2 What is a Virus?\nViruses were originally said to be tiny objects that can pass through filters (unlike bacteria), but nonetheless, a virus is a tiny particle that has genetic material, a protein shell, and sometimes, a fatty covering.\nViruses can be differerently complex in terms of their genetic or molecular makeup, but their genomes don’t encode for a lot of proteins.\nThat said, viruses must utilize host cell machinery to survive - they also maintain close contact with cells. So, scientists need to grow viruses in cells to study them. All viruses also follow certain steps (see below) to make copies of themselves - these steps are similar for all viruses.\n\n1.2.1 Stages of Virus Replication\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneral Schematic of How Viruses Replicate Using a Paramyxovirus\n\n\n\n\nThe basic stages (using the paramyxovirus) include:\n\nAttachment and Entry Uncoating\nViruses stick to cells to get in them. They then release their genetic material when they’re inside the cell.\nReplication and Transcription\nThe virus’ genetic material takes over the cell’s machinery to make new genetic material and proteins. This creates more virus parts.\nAssembly\nThe genetic material and proteins form new virus particles.\nRelease\nThe virus particles break free from the cell and infect other cells. Everything repeats itself.\n\n\n\n1.2.2 Virus Classification\nThe taxonomic method used to group viruses is polythetic - a virus group is described by its properties. Some properties used to describe viruses include:\n\nMorphology\nThis refers to the virus’ size, shape, capsid symmetry, and whether it has an envelope or not.\n\n\n\n\n\nViruses at Different Sizes\n\n\n\n\nHow big a virus is affects the way it interacts with its host.\nPhysical Properties\nThis refers to the virus’ genome, its response to physical and / or chemical agents, and its antigenic properties.\nBiological Properties\nThis refers to the virus’ replication methods, hosts, transmission modes, and also how infectious it is.\n\nThoguh, the following metrics can be used as well:\n\nGenetic Material\nViruses can also contain RNA instead of DNA.\nGenome Structure\nThey can be single or multiple-copied, single or double stranded (i.e., “ss” or “ds”), and have various orientations (i.e., +ve like mRNA or -ve sense).\nEnveloped or Non-Enveloped Status\nViruses can come with or without lipid envelopes. For those without envelopes, they have a capsid structure and have Icosahedral symmetry (i.e., two, three, and five-fold symmetry).\n\n\n\n\n\nA Virus with a Lipid Envelope\n\n\n\n\nViruses that have envelopes have something called a lipid bilayer surrounding them. Spike proteins - “little arms” that stick out from the bilayer are usually found too; the arms can help the virus anchor onto surfaces.\n\n\n\n1.2.3 Virus Taxonomy\nScientists who study viruses use a system by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (i.e., ICTV) to organize and name them. The system starts with the biggest group “order” before going down to more specific sub-levels (i.e., “class”, “order”, “family”, etc). There are also special rules for naming and writing descriptions for viruses.\nFor instance, the human respiratory syncytial virus (i.e., RSV) can be classified using this system as:\n\nIt’s in the “Mononegavirales” order\nIt’s in the “Paramyxoviridae” family\nIt’s in the “Pneumovirinae” subfamily\nIt’s in the “Pneumovirus” genus\nIt’s called “Human respiratory syncytial virus” as a species\n\nScientists also tell viruses apart by looking at their genetic sequences. For instance, there’s a type of RSV called “RSV A2” and another called “RSV Long Isolates”."

The amount of bacteria in the human stomach is weighs about a kilogram and the average human adult will poop their own weight in bacteria each year. 8% of viral DNA also comes from what is left of viral genomes.\nThere are about 1400 types of disease-causing organisms that affect humans, for instance, fungi, bacteria, viruses, and more. Yet, these organisms also make up less than a percent of all the microbes on Earth. Scientists think that there could be 120000 to millions of different microbe species in total and that we’ve only studied an incredibly small portion of DNA on Earth1.\n\n1.3.1 Natural Reservoirs of Human Infection\n\n\n\n\n\nSome Examples of Virus Reservoirs\n\n\n\n\nViruses can live inside hosts. An infection happens when the virus jumps ship from a host to another person who isn’t infected. The source of virus infections is a significant factor in controlling diseases."

    "text": "1.4 What Does the Future Hold?\n\n\n\n\n\nPolio Hieroglyphs from Ancient Egypt\n\n\n\n\nExperts think that the first ever record of a viral infection was in a hieroglyph from Memphis - ancient Egypt’s capital - from about 3700 BCE. In this hieroglyph, Ruma - a temple priest - is showing signs of paralytic poliomyelitis.\n\n\n\n\n\nSmallpox on an Egyptian Mummy\n\n\n\n\nThere’s also reason to believe that a smallpox outbreak happened in Ancient Egypt, 1157 BC. There’s evidence of smallpox on Ramses V’s mummy.\n\n1.4.1 First Steps to Understanding Viruses\nApproaches have been devised in the past to deal with viruses and other infectious diseases:\n\nVariolation\n\n\n\n\n\nAn Ancient Chinese Physician Variolating a Person\n\n\n\n\nThe ancient Chinese inhaled dried scabs from smallpox survivors while the Turks and the Europeans used pus from a lesion. This was based on the observation that smallpox survivors were immune to subsequent smallpox infections.\nVaccination\n\n\n\n\n\nEdward Jenner Vaccinating a Young Boy Against Smallpox\n\n\n\n\nEdward Jenner noticed that milkmaids who contracted cowpox - a milder variant of smallpox - do not contract smallpox.\nSo, he suggestd infecting people with cowpox to make someone immune against smallpox. Jenner would then go ahead and infect a young boy with cowpox lesions; he would then go ahead and expose the boy to smallpox a couple of days later.\nAlthough his work was initially met with ridicule, it was eventually met with acceptance.\nFurther Attempts\nBack in 1892, a scientist named Dmitri Iwanowski found that something from sick tobacco plants could make healthy plants sick too. This “something” could pass through filters that catch small things.\nThen, in 1898, Freidrich Loeffler and Paul Frosch discovered that a similar tiny thing caused foot-and-mouth disease in cattle. So these things weren’t just affecting plants, they were causing problems in animals too.\nLater, in 1908, Karl Landsteiner and Erwin Popper showed that poliomyelitis, a disease that affects the nerves, was also caused by one of these tiny things. This was the first time we realized that viruses could infect not only animals but humans as well.\n\nIn 1915, a scientist named Frederick Twort was the first to notice viruses that can infect bacteria\n\n\n1.4.2 Beginning of Molecular Virology\nIn 1977, Frederick Sanger and his team figured out the whole order of 5,375 building blocks (nucleotides) in the genome of a virus called bacteriophage fX174. This was a big deal and they even won the Nobel Prize in 1980 for it. This was the very first time anyone had completely figured out the order of all the parts in a living thing’s genome.\nThen, in 1983, scientists Luc Montagnier and Robert Gallo made a huge announcement. They found a virus named human immunodeficiency virus (i.e., HIV) which causes AIDS. This happened just two years after AIDS started spreading, so it was a quick discovery."

    "text": "2.1 Virus Attachment\nWhen a virus wants to get into a cell, it starts by attaching itself to the cell’s surface. This only works if the virus can connect with certain cell surface parts called receptors. It’s the initial step in the process.\n\n2.1.1 Attachment for Enveloped Viruses\n\n\n\n\n\nTypes of Spikes Used by Enveloped Viruses\n\n\n\n\nViruses use their proteins to attach to cells. Viruses with envelopes do this wtih spikes on their surface. There are two types of these spikes covered in this course:\n\nType I\nExamples are HIV’s gp120 and the HA protein in influenza viruses.\nType II\nThis includes the G protein in paramyxoviruses.\n\n\n\n2.1.2 Non-Enveloped Viruses\nNon-enveloped viruses have a different way of attaching to cells. They use parts that stick out from their outer shell, called the capsid. These parts can be:\n\nProjections\n\n\n\n\n\nCapsid Projections in the Adenovirus\n\n\n\n\nLike the trimeric fiber proteins in Adenovirus.\nRegions\n\n\n\n\n\nCapsid Protein C\n\n\n\n\nSome parts of the capsid protein, such as the “canyon” in picornaviruses.\n\n\n\n2.1.3 Cell Receptors\nViruses use cell receptors to stick to cells. These are like keys that fit into specific locks on the cell’s surface. There are two main types of receptors: proteins and carbohydrates.\nViruses can connect to primary receptors, which are like main locks, and sometimes to secondary receptors, which are like extra locks. For example, HIV-1 uses CD4 as its main lock, and CCR5 is like an extra lock.\n\n2.1.3.1 Protein Receptors\n\n\n\n\n\nVarious Types of Protein Receptors on Host Cells\n\n\n\n\nThere are many different molecules on the surface of cells that act like doors for viruses.\nSome of these molecules don’t seem to do anything else (e.g., PVR for Poliovirus), while others have a specific job (e.g., CD55 for Echovirus, which helps with the immune system).\n\n2.1.3.1.1 Identifying Protein Receptors\nThere are several ways:\n\nUsing Specific Monoclonal Antibodies\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing Antibodies to Detect Virus Binding\n\n\n\n\nOne way is by using specific monoclonal antibodies, which are like tiny soldiers that target and block the virus from sticking to the receptor. Another method is to use a receptor in a soluble form, like a decoy, to catch the virus before it attaches. Lastly, researchers might use a receptor antagonist, which is like a blocker, to prevent the virus from binding to the receptor.\nTo see if the virus is there, scientists can use something called ELISA, which is a bit like a virus detector test for the cell’s surface.\nVirus Overlay Protein Blot Assay\n\n\n\n\n\nA Schematic of a Blot Assay\n\n\n\n\nIt’s a bit like when placing a sticker on a piece of paper. The virus sticks to these proteins that are put on a special paper. For example, the lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus sticks to a protein called α-dystroglycan that’s on the paper. This helps scientists understand how viruses attach to cells.\n\n\n\n\n2.1.3.2 Carbohydrate Receptors\n\n\n\n\n\nExamples of Carbohydrate Receptors\n\n\n\n\nCertain viruses have developed a clever strategy – they’ve learned to attach to carbohydrate molecules on the surface of cells. These carbohydrates are like flags on the cells, made of special sugars. These flags are found on proteins and fats on the cell’s surface. The fascinating thing is that these flags are present on cells from various animals. So, these viruses can infect a wide range of hosts, kind of like having a key that fits many different locks.\n\n2.1.3.2.1 Identifyign Carbohydrate Receptors\nThere are three main ways:\n\nVirus Protein Properties\n\n\n\n\n\nA Schematic of the Sendai (i.e., Paramyxovirus) Virus\n\n\n\n\nSometimes, the characteristics of certain virus proteins can provide hints about how they work.\nFor instance, some viruses have proteins with sugar molecules attached (glycoproteins), and these proteins can do interesting things. For example, the attachment protein (HN) in the Sendai virus has a special ability called neuraminidase activity, which suggests that a sugar molecule called sialic acid might be really important for the virus to stick to cells.\nEnzymes that Remove or Destroy a type of Carbohydrate\n\n\n\n\n\nDestroying a Certain Kind of Carbohydrate\n\n\n\n\nThere are enzymes that can do just that! One of these enzymes is called neuraminidase (NA), and it works by removing a particular kind of sugar molecule called sialic acid from the cell’s surface.\nThis sugar is like a lock that the influenza A virus uses to attach to cells. When we use neuraminidase to take away this lock, the virus can’t get in. This is like having a way to break the virus’s key, so it can’t open the cell’s door anymore.\nAntibodies to Block Virus Attachment\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing Proteins to Inhibit Virus Binding\n\n\n\n\nThink of antibodies as tiny warriors that can fight against viruses. Some antibodies are really good at stopping viruses from attaching to cells. For instance, there’s a specific antibody called anti-galactosyl ceramide that can act like a shield to block HIV from infecting cells. It’s like having a superhero shield that stops the virus from getting close to the cell’s entrance.\n\n\n\n\n\n2.1.4 Why Target Virus Receptors?\nFinding out about virus receptors is like discovering the virus’s weak point. When we know which parts of cells the virus uses to attach, we can figure out how to stop it. This means we might be able to prevent the virus from getting into cells in the first place. There are different ways to do this, like using special antibodies that can neutralize the virus or using a kind of decoy - a soluble form of the receptor - that tricks the virus into attaching to it instead of the real cells. It’s like setting up traps to catch the virus before it can cause harm."

To do this, the virus triggers certain signals that help it get inside the cell. It’s like the virus is sending messages to open the cell’s door. When the virus first connects with the receptor, it can set off a chain reaction of signals.\n\n\n\n\n\nVarious Cell Structures in Virus Entry\n\n\n\n\nFor example, the Adenovirus uses a receptor called integrin a2b3. When this connection happens, it’s like pressing a button that activates different processes inside the cell. This includes things like PI3K getting activated, which is like starting a car’s engine. Then, molecules like PIP3 work like fuel, making another process called rho GTPases start. This process changes the cell’s shape, helping the virus get inside. It’s kind of like the virus is using a series of switches and levers to open a secret door into the cell."

    "section": "2.3 Virus Entry",
    "text": "2.3 Virus Entry\nEnveloped viruses have two main ways to enter cells. First, they can fuse their outer layer with the cell’s outer layer, like two bubbles merging. Second, they can hitch a ride inside the cell through a process called receptor-mediated endocytosis, like a Trojan horse sneaking in.\nOn the other hand, non-enveloped viruses use different tactics to get inside cells. For example, the poliovirus changes its shape when it connects to a receptor (i.e., A particles), creating a tiny hole in the endosome where it’s trapped. Through this hole, the virus’s genetic material can slip into the cell, a bit like a secret passage being unlocked.\n\n2.3.1 Viral Fusion Proteins\n\n\n\n\n\nActivation of a Viral Fusion Protein via Proteolysis\n\n\n\n\nVirus fusion proteins are a special kind of membrane protein that help viruses merge their outer layer with a cell’s outer layer. Some examples are the influenza virus’s hemagglutinin (HA), SARS CoV-2’s S protein, and dengue virus’s E protein.\nThese proteins usually start in a quiet state, not ready to fuse. But then, they change into an active form, like waking up, thanks to certain actions like proteolysis. Another trigger then turns this active form into the even more active “fusogenic” form.\nIn this supercharged state, a part of the protein that doesn’t like water gets stuck into the cell’s outer layer. The fusion protein then twists and changes shape, making the virus and cell outer layers join together, a bit like a zipper closing.\n\n\n2.3.2 Mechanisms by Enveloped Viruses\n\n\n\n\n\npH Dependent and pH Independent Viruses\n\n\n\n\nThere are two ways enveloped viruses can enter cells: ones that care about pH and ones that don’t. We can tell the difference by using special compounds like chloroquine and monensin, which stop acidic stuff in the endosomes from working. The way a virus enters depends on its fusion protein, a bit like how different keys fit different locks.\n\n2.3.2.1 Example of a pH Dependent Mechanism\n\n\n\n\n\nHA Helping an Influenza Virus Gain Entry into a Cell\n\n\n\n\nFirst, the virus sticks to a receptor called sialic acid, and the cell brings it inside using endocytosis, like a package delivery.\nInside the cell, the endosome’s pH becomes more acidic, like a lemon. This acid bath causes a transformation in the virus’s hemagglutinin (i.e., HA) protein. It goes from a quiet state to a supercharged one, ready to fuse. This HA now acts like a bridge between the virus and the endosomal membrane. It pulls them together, making them become one, like joining two puzzle pieces.\n\n\n2.3.2.2 Example of a pH Independent Mechanism\n\n\n\n\n\nSendai Virus Gaining Entry into a Cell\n\n\n\n\nFusion happens at a normal pH, like the one in our bodies, and it’s controlled by a special virus protein called the fusion (F) protein.\nThe process begins with the virus attachment protein (HN) connecting to the cell’s receptor (sialic acid). This connection makes the HN change shape. This shape change then causes the F protein to also change shape. Think of it like a domino effect: the first domino (HN) falls, which makes the second one (F protein) tip over. This change in the F protein is like a key turning in a lock, allowing the virus and cell membranes to fuse together, a bit like two soap bubbles merging.\n\n\n2.3.2.3 Cell-to-Cell Fusion Virus Transmission\n\n\n\n\n\nViral Fusion Transmission\n\n\n\n\nSometimes, infection can happen in a unique way: the outer shell of an infected cell fuses directly with an uninfected cell’s outer shell.\nThis fusion can lead to the creation of big cells with multiple nuclei, kind of like cells joining together to form a team. This is seen in various tissues and cells.\nA group of viruses called paramyxoviruses, such as the respiratory syncytial virus, are known to cause this kind of fusion. It’s like the viruses are playing a trick, making cells merge and work together, but it’s not for the good – it helps the virus spread.\n\n\n\n2.3.3 Mechanisms by Non-Enveloped Viruses\nNon-enveloped viruses have another way to get their genetic material into cells.\nOne way is by creating a protein-made pore in the cell’s outer layer. Think of it like poking a small hole in a balloon.\nAnother way is by messing up the cell’s outer layer when the virus is taken inside through endocytosis. It’s like opening a door, but making a bit of a mess in the process. This helps the virus get its genetic material where it needs to go.\n\n2.3.3.1 Example: Poliovirus Uncoating\n\n\n\n\n\nPoliovirus Uncoating Mechanism\n\n\n\n\nPoliovirus goes through a series of shape changes when it meets the cell’s surface. These changes help the virus send its genetic material inside the cell.\nScientists can tell these different forms apart by how they behave when spun in a machine called a centrifuge. It’s like sorting different types of beads by spinning them really fast – each type settles at a different level."

Imagine driving a longer distance on a big road.\nThese capsids can hitch rides in endocytic vesicles, like getting inside small vehicles. They then travel through the cell’s interior, where they link up with tiny motors like dynein. These motors help them move, a bit like being pulled along by a tiny train."

This genetic material is enclosed by a matrix protein.\nThe matrix protein gets separated from the genetic material through a process where the virus’s interior becomes more acidic. This acidification is helped by a protein called M2 that the virus carries with it. It’s like the virus has a special key that makes the interior more acidic, and this helps unlock the genetic material from the matrix protein.\n\n2.5.1 Example: Influenza Virus\n\n\n\n\n\nUncoating of the Influenza Virus\n\n\n\n\nWhen it comes to influenza virus, uncoating involves a specific process. The M2 ion channel, acting like a tiny gate, lets protons from the endosome into the virus. This makes the virus’s insides more acidic, which helps break apart the connection between the M1 protein and the ribonucleoproteins (RNPs, which carry the genetic material).\nThis process is quite important for designing antiviral drugs. For instance, amantadine is a drug that interferes with the activity of the M2 protein. By blocking the M2 protein’s function, it’s like putting a lock on that tiny gate and preventing the virus from undergoing the uncoating process effectively."

This NLS acts like a passport that allows the virus proteins entry into the nucleus. This process can also affect the virus’s ability to infect different hosts, like how the flu virus’s host range might be determined in part by whether its proteins can be recognized by importin proteins.\n\nNPCs have a diameter of about 39 nanometers. Only the smallest virus capsids, such as Parvovirus, can fit through without any changes. However, larger viruses face a challenge due to their big size. They need to undergo some changes, like taking off a piece of their outer layer.\n\n\n\n\n\nVarious Viruses’ Nuclear Import Mechanism\n\n\n\n\nFor example, the adenovirus changes its structure a bit and attaches to specific parts of the NPC, allowing its DNA to slip through. In the case of viruses like HSV (herpes simplex virus), they have special proteins that help them grab onto the NPC, and this helps their DNA get inside the nucleus. For viruses like influenza, which has a segmented genome, the individual segments (kind of like puzzle pieces) go through the NPC one by one. It’s like getting a large piece of furniture through a narrow doorway by taking it apart and reassembling it inside."

Moreover, it can have single or double strands, and its shape can be linear or circular. The way the genetic material reads can also be single-stranded, double-stranded, or a mix of both (i.e., ambisense polarity). In terms of numbers, there are more double-stranded DNA viruses compared to single-stranded DNA viruses, while there are more single-stranded RNA viruses than double-stranded RNA viruses. Additionally, virus genomes can be either single segments or divided into multiple segments.\nWhere the genome replication takes place can vary as well, with some happening in the cell nucleus and others in the cytoplasm. Most DNA viruses replicate their genome in the cell nucleus, whereas most RNA viruses do so in the cytoplasm. The structure of the genome has an impact on how the virus itself is structured. For instance, in certain viruses, an enzyme called polymerase needs to be packed together with the virus’s genetic material.\nWhen it comes to DNA viruses, their genomes can differ in size. There are small ones, like parvovirus, with genomes of up to 9,000 bases, intermediate-sized ones around 35,000 bases, such as Adenoviruses, and larger ones ranging from 130,000 to 350,000 bases, like the Herpes virus. The larger DNA viruses even have the capacity to encode enzymes involved in DNA synthesis (polymerases) and factors that control transcription processes.\n\n3.1.1 DNA Viruses\nDNA viruses have different sizes for their genetic information. Some have small genomes, like the parvovirus, which can be up to 9,000 bases long. Then there are those with intermediate-sized genomes, like Adenoviruses, which are around 35,000 bases in length. On the larger end of the spectrum, there are viruses like the Herpes virus, which have genomes ranging from 130,000 to 350,000 bases. The interesting thing about these larger viruses is that they’re capable of carrying extra genetic instructions for important tasks like producing polymerase enzymes and factors that help regulate the process of transcription.\n\n3.1.1.1 Regulating Gene Expression\nThe way DNA viruses control the information in their genes is quite intriguing. They manage their gene expression in a couple of distinctive phases. One of these phases is called early gene expression, and it involves a group of genes that are not related to the structure of the virus but are crucial for tasks like copying the viral DNA and changing the cell’s environment to favor the virus. Then there’s “late gene expression,” which handles genes responsible for constructing the virus’s structural components.\nDNA viruses also have this switch between early and late gene expression. In the early phase, the genes responsible for kick-starting important reactions tend to be active, even though their expression might not be very intense. This early stage focuses on producing the essential building blocks. But when it comes to the late phase, the genes that create the structural parts of the virus, like its outer shell, become more active. This is because a lot more of these structural components are required.\nInterestingly, certain viruses, like the Herpes virus, take a middle ground. They have genes that work in between the early and late stages. These genes play a role in controlling the expression of late genes, acting like traffic directors for the production of structural components.\nThis whole process is like a cascade of gene expression, where different genes are turned on and off at different times to ensure the virus can both replicate and assemble its components effectively.\n\n3.1.1.1.1 Further Notes\nGenes have a bit of a helper in their instructions, sort of like a bonus sequence called enhancer sequences. These enhancers make it easier for certain special tools, called factors, to stick to the gene’s instructions and help them work better.\nWhen a virus wants to create certain things at a later stage, it needs the help of things it made early on, like a team effort. These early things and some tools from the cell work together to make the later things happen.\nImagine a virus being a bit of a sneaky character – it can mess with the cell’s work by speeding up the breakdown of the cell’s messages. This makes more room for its own messages, kind of like it’s turning up the volume on its own plans.\nVirus instructions can be read in different places. Most DNA viruses, which are like tiny invaders, use the cell’s own reading machinery found in the cell’s nucleus. But some viruses are a bit different; they hang out and multiply in the cell’s playground (cytoplasm). These viruses bring their own special tools, like little helpers they made themselves, to read their instructions.\n\n\n\n3.1.1.2 How do DNA Viruses Replicate?\n\n\n\n\n\nPhases of the Cell Cycle\n\n\n\n\nA lot of DNA viruses make use of a special tool called the host cell DNA polymerase to copy their own genetic material. This is interesting because the host cell usually copies its DNA during a specific phase called the S phase.\nDNA Viruses use three main ways to replicate:\n\nWaiting for the Cell’s S Phase\n\n\n\n\n\nWaiting for the S Phase to Replicate\n\n\n\n\nImagine DNA viruses like parvovirus as patient waiters. They’re polite viruses that know they need something from the cell to help them replicate. So, they patiently wait for the cell to enter a special phase called the “S phase,” which is like a busy time for the cell when it’s copying its own DNA. During this time, the cell has a special worker called DNA polymerase who’s really good at copying DNA.\nNow, when the cell enters this S phase and starts copying its DNA, the parvovirus sees its chance. It steps up and says, “Hey, can you help me copy my DNA too?” Since the cell’s DNA polymerase is already busy copying the cell’s own DNA, it doesn’t mind helping out the virus at the same time. This way, the virus gets its DNA copied when the cell’s DNA is being copied, making things easier for both the virus and the cell.\nExpressing Early Genes\n\n\n\n\n\nExpressing Early Genes to Cause Cells to Enter S Phase\n\n\n\n\nDNA viruses can sometimes use a sneaky trick to copy themselves. They have some special genes called “early genes,” which can act like switches that tell the cell to start dividing. This phase when the cell starts dividing is called the S phase.\nBy turning on these early genes, the virus kind of tricks the cell into thinking it’s time to divide. This is useful for the virus because during the cell’s S phase, it’s copying its own DNA, and the virus can use the cell’s copying machinery to make copies of itself too.\nSo, viruses like papillomavirus and adenovirus use this trick to make sure they get copied when the cell divides.\nEncoding DNA Replication Enzymes\n\n\n\n\n\nDNA Replication Enzymes\n\n\n\n\nImagine DNA viruses as tiny machines that need to make copies of themselves. Some of these viruses have big instruction manuals (genomes) that are a bit complex. To help with the copying process, these viruses come with their own special tools called DNA replication enzymes.\nThese enzymes, like DNA polymerase and Thymidine kinase, are like super-fast copiers. They read the instructions in the virus’s manual and make exact copies really quickly. This way, the virus can make sure it has plenty of copies to spread around and infect more cells.\nReverse Transcription\n\n\n\n\n\nStructure of the Hepatitis B Virus\n\n\n\n\nImagine the Hepatitis B virus having a unique mechanism, like a special method, for copying its instructions. Instead of having a regular circular DNA, its genetic material is mostly double-stranded and circular, but it’s not fully connected. This type of DNA is called relaxed circular DNA, or rcDNA for short.\nThis rcDNA has two parts: one is the minus-sense DNA strand, which is like the main part of the virus’s instructions. It’s connected to a special protein called the P protein at one end. The other part is the plus-sense DNA strand, which is shorter than the main part. It’s like a shortened version of the instructions. At one end of this shorter strand, there’s something called an RNA primer attached.\nSo, in simple terms, when the Hepatitis B virus wants to make copies of itself, it uses this special rcDNA method. It has one long piece of instructions (minus-sense DNA) connected to a protein, and another shorter piece (plus-sense DNA) with a tiny starter tag (RNA primer) attached. This unique way of copying its genes helps the virus spread and cause infections.\nIn the case of the Hepatitis B virus, the following steps occur:\n\nrcDNA goes into the cell’s nucleus and turns into a closed circle with the help of the cell’s own tools.\nThe circle of DNA then gets turned into a type of “note” called subgenomic RNA by another tool in the cell.\nThis special “note” helps make important parts of the virus, like its protective shell.\nThere’s a special “note” in there called pregenomic RNA (i.e., pgRNA), which has all the virus’s instructions.\nThe pgRNA gets wrapped up with a protein coat called capsid and another tool from the virus.\nA part of the pgRNA gets turned around, almost like a mirror image, to create a different kind of DNA.\nWhile doing this, the tool from the virus breaks down some parts of the pgRNA to help with the process.\nThe tool uses a tiny piece of the pgRNA as a starting point to create a new piece of DNA that’s important for the virus’s plan.\n\n\n\n\n\n3.1.2 RNA Viruses\n\n\n\n\n\nVisualizations of RNA Viruses\n\n\n\n\nViruses are like little code carriers, and some have instructions made of a special material called RNA. Unlike our own cells, which usually use DNA, these viruses are unique with their RNA instructions. This means that the cell’s copying tools, called polymerases, can’t directly copy these RNA instructions.\nWhen these RNA viruses want to make more of themselves, they have their own tricks. Some use something called an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RDRP) to copy their RNA instructions. It’s like a super-fast copier that can work with RNA. In some cases, like with HIV-1, the virus even has a special tool called RNA-dependent DNA polymerase that helps convert the RNA instructions into DNA.\nThese RNA viruses can have two types of polarity, which is like the direction in which they read their instructions. They can read their instructions in a positive direction (+ve polarity) or in a negative direction (-ve polarity).\nNow, here’s something interesting about -ve stranded viruses. Their RNA instructions are wrapped up in a special package called a nucleocapsid. It’s like their instructions are tucked away in a protective case, keeping them safe while the virus works on copying and spreading.\n\n3.1.2.1 Replication Sites\nWhen RNA viruses want to make more of themselves, most of them do it right in the cell’s playground, called the cytoplasm. But there are a few exceptions, like the influenza virus and HIV-1, which prefer a different spot.\nWhere the virus chooses to replicate, whether in the cytoplasm or somewhere else, actually matters a lot. Think of it like this: certain tasks are easier in certain places. For example, just like how we might have a special room for studying, cells have different rooms for different jobs. The place where a virus copies itself can affect how it does it. For instance, in the cell’s nucleus, a process called gene splicing happens. It’s like putting together different parts of instructions in a certain way. Influenza virus uses this process.\nNow, here’s something cool. Some viruses that usually work in the cell’s playground, the cytoplasm, have developed their own special way of doing things. They’ve found a trick to create gene products that look like they’ve been spliced, even though they didn’t use the cell’s usual room for that. One example of this is RSV.\nSo, where a virus chooses to make more of itself affects how it does it, and some viruses even have clever strategies to get their work done in their favorite spots.\n\n\n3.1.2.2 Replication Stratagies\n\n3.1.2.2.1 Positive Stranded RNA Viruses\n\n\n\n\n\nRNA Replication in Positive Sense RNA Viruses\n\n\n\n\nPositive-stranded RNA viruses have a nifty way of getting things done. They use their instructions directly to make stuff. It’s like reading a recipe and instantly cooking up a dish.\nJust like how a recipe can be shared and someone else can make the same dish, these viruses can spread by sharing their “recipe” too. If you take the genetic instructions from these viruses and put them in a new cell, it can start making more viruses just by reading those instructions.\nThe main set of instructions in these viruses is a special kind of RNA, and this RNA gets turned into a whole bunch of different parts that the virus needs, both the important structural pieces and the things that help it copy itself.\nSo, in simple terms, these positive-stranded RNA viruses have a unique method where their instructions are like instant blueprints for making all the tools and parts they need. And these instructions can even be shared to make new viruses.\n\n3.1.2.2.1.1 Further Notes\nSome viruses, like dengue, have a straightforward way of doing things. They don’t bother with making special notes, and instead, they put all their important instructions in one place. It’s like having a single recipe that includes everything they need to make.\nBut then there are other viruses, such as norovirus, that work a bit differently. They’re like chefs who have a master plan. First, they create a base mixture that will later help them make important tools (proteins). This special mixture is a bit like a dough that’s used for various things.\nOnce this mixture is ready, another tool in the virus starts working like a chef’s hands. It takes parts of the mixture and shapes them into different types of tools, just like a baker making different types of cookies from the same dough.\n\n\n\n3.1.2.2.2 Negative Stranded RNA Viruses\nSome viruses, known as negative-stranded RNA viruses, have a unique trait. The genetic information they carry isn’t directly able to start an infection. It’s like having a puzzle piece that doesn’t fit until you add something extra.\n\n\n\n\n\nNegative-Sense RNA Viruses\n\n\n\n\nThese viruses, however, come prepared. When they enter a cell, they bring along a special helper called a polymerase. This helper is like a construction worker who carries the tools needed to build something.\nFor these viruses, the first step to making more copies of themselves involves making a copy of their genetic material, but in the opposite direction. It’s like making a mirror image of a picture. This new copy then becomes the template to create more of the original genetic material.\nThis newly created copy now acts as a guidebook. It’s used to produce special messages called mRNA, which tell the cell how to build parts of the virus.\nSo, in a nutshell, these negative-stranded RNA viruses can’t start an infection right away with their genetic material. They bring a helper along, copy their genetic info in a special way, and use that copy to create important messages to build their virus parts.\n\n\n\n3.1.2.3 Ambisense RNA Viruses\n\n\n\n\n\nAmbisense RNA Viruses\n\n\n\n\nImagine some viruses are like two-sided books. One side has a positive story, and the other side has a negative story. These viruses, called ambisense RNA viruses, are a bit like that.\nIn these viruses, the genetic material is set up in a special way. It’s like having a book where one end has a sad story (negative) and the other end has a happy story (positive).\nWhen these viruses want to do their thing, they don’t just read the stories. They take the negative side and use it to make a messenger, like a note with important instructions. This note helps make a part of the virus.\nBut then, they also use the positive side to make something else. This time, it’s like they’re using it to make a special kind of worker. This worker helps create a copy of the negative side, kind of like making more copies of the sad story.\nThese new copies are like templates, and they’re used to make more workers and more important notes. So, these ambisense viruses do things in a special way, using both sides of their “book” to create different parts of themselves.\n\n\n3.1.2.4 Double-Stranded RNA Viruses\n\n\n\n\n\nDouble-Stranded RNA Viruses\n\n\n\n\nThink of some viruses like a book with two sides. One side is the “main story” (genomic RNA), but it’s locked away in a special case that’s not infectious by itself.\nWhen these viruses want to do their thing, they open the case and make copies of one side of the story (making +ve single stranded RNA). These copies are like summarized versions of the main story.\nThen, these copies are turned into workers (proteins) that join together and form a team (subviral particles). Imagine each worker has a special job, and when they work together, they create something new.\nInterestingly, these workers also play a role in making new cases. They include the summarized copies (i.e., ssRNA) inside these new cases. These cases, in turn, help create more of the main story (genomic RNA) by using the summarized versions as templates.\nSo, these double-stranded RNA viruses work like bookkeepers, using copies of one side of the story to create teams and new cases that eventually help make more complete stories.\n\n\n\n3.1.3 Quasispecies\n\n\n\n\n\nVisualizations of Quasispecies\n\n\n\n\nThe way viruses copy their instructions isn’t always perfect. Some viruses, like those with RNA instructions, don’t have a good proofreading system in place, except for some like CoV. This means they sometimes make mistakes when copying.\nThese copying mistakes make these viruses a bit like a big family with lots of cousins. They have a bunch of similar sequences, but they’re not exactly the same. This is called a quasispecies, where a virus family has different related members in one big group.\nImagine this: when these viruses copy themselves, they might make around 1 mistake in every 10,000 letters. That’s like writing a really long story and making a couple of typos.\nThe number of these viruses in a group can be huge, like having 100 million influenza virus particles in a tiny drop of liquid.\nBecause of these mistakes and the large number of viruses, you end up with lots of closely related but slightly different viruses in the family. This mix of similar but not identical viruses is what we call a quasispecies.\nThink of it like this: in a big group of friends, everyone is different in their own way, but they still belong to the same group. These virus families have their own versions too, but they’re all part of the same viral family. Some versions might be better at certain things, like surviving in different environments or against drugs or antibodies.\n\n\n3.1.4 Retroviruses\n\n\n\n\n\nIllustration of Retroviruses\n\n\n\n\nImagine retroviruses like treasure hunters. They carry a special tool called reverse transcriptase (i.e., RT) that helps them convert their single-stranded RNA into double-stranded DNA. It’s like turning a one-sided note into a two-sided page.\nWhen these retroviruses enter a cell, they bring this tool with them. It’s kind of like they have a helper in their backpack.\nThen, this double-stranded DNA finds a cozy spot to settle down in the cell’s own bookshelf, which is like the host genome. It’s like placing a piece of paper into a big book.\nThis settled DNA is called a provirus. Think of it as a bookmark that’s stuck in the book forever.\nThe cell’s own tools, like its “RNA polymerase,” read this bookmark and create something new based on the instructions. It’s like the cell taking inspiration from the bookmark and writing a new story."

It’s like they easily understand the cell’s machines for reading instructions. Their instructions are built to fit these machines, like they have a special key that works perfectly. Imagine it’s like putting together a puzzle, where all the pieces match.\nFor negative-strand viruses, these are a bit different. They’re like the “mysterious” viruses. They don’t focus on using the cell’s tools to make stuff. Instead, they have their own tools, like a special writer, to create new things. So, their instructions are like their own secret code, and they don’t necessarily fit the cell’s machines like the positive-strand viruses do.\n\n3.2.1 Baltimore Virus Classification\n\n\n\n\n\nDiagram Illustrating the Baltimore Classification System for Viruses\n\n\n\n\nThe system has seven groups:\n\nDouble-stranded DNA viruses\nThey’re like masters of making copies of themselves, and they include viruses like poxviruses.\nSingle-stranded DNA viruses\nThese are like “positive” thinkers. They use their own instructions to create things, like parvoviruses do.\nDouble-stranded RNA viruses\nThey have a different way of copying themselves, like reoviruses.\nPositive single-stranded RNA viruses\nThese are like the “happy storytellers.” They read their instructions directly and make lots of things, just like picornaviruses do.\nNegative single-stranded RNA viruses\nThese viruses have their own mysterious code. They don’t match the cell’s instructions exactly, and they include viruses like orthomyxoviruses.\nRNA-RT viruses\nThey’re kind of like the time travelers. They use their RNA instructions to create DNA temporarily, and this DNA helps them make more copies of themselves. Retroviruses, like HIV-1, belong to this group.\nDNA-RT viruses\nThese are like the “retro” writers. They use their DNA to make a special type of DNA with a twist, and hepadnaviruses are an example."

This results in a double-sided RNA, which is a signal for the cell’s defense system, like a guard alert.\nTo avoid causing too much trouble for the cell, RNA viruses need to control how much they make. Imagine it’s like not making too much noise in someone else’s house.\nWhen positive-strand viruses copy their RNA, they can create both the tools they need (proteins) and new instruction manuals (virus genomes). This means they don’t make too many opposite-sided copies (negative strands), only a small amount.\nFor negative-strand viruses, it’s a bit different. They need lots of both sides of their instructions to function well, like having both pages of a book to read. These instructions are always wrapped up with a protective cover, so the two sides don’t stick together and cause problems."

Imagine if you had a book where the first page had instructions for making five different things, like a robot, a cake, and a car. This is like how a virus’s instructions are set up.\nThe virus’s tools for making things sometimes struggle to read these mixed-up instructions and start making things at the right spots. It’s like having trouble starting to build the robot before making the cake.\n\n3.5.1 Processing at Genetic Level\nImagine these viruses having a big recipe book. But instead of separate recipes for each dish, they have one big recipe that can make many dishes. This big recipe is like a “polyprotein.”\nTo make these dishes, the virus needs some help. It’s like having a chef (protease) from both the virus and the cell’s kitchen. These chefs work together to cut and prepare the different dishes from the big recipe.\nIn some cases, these viruses have a special trick. It’s like having a shortcut in the recipe book, called an “internal ribosome entry site” or IRES. This shortcut helps the virus start cooking from a specific page, even though the recipe is mixed up.\n\n\n3.5.2 On-off Mechanism\nThink of the virus like a reader going through a long storybook. This storybook has different chapters, each talking about something different.\nFor viruses like Paramyxoviruses, they have a cool trick. It’s like having a “magic stop sign” at the end of each chapter. When the reader (viral polymerase) reaches this stop sign, it takes a pause and then moves to the start of the next chapter.\nImagine you’re reading a book, and when you reach the end of a chapter, you automatically move to the start of the next chapter. This is how these viruses create individual messages from their big story (genome).\n\n\n3.5.3 Using Multiple Genomic Segments\n\n\n\n\n\nMultiple Genomic Segments\n\n\n\n\nImagine a puzzle, but instead of one big piece, it’s made up of smaller pieces. Some viruses, like influenza, work like this puzzle.\nInstead of putting all the instructions for making the virus in one place, these viruses spread them out. It’s like having different pieces of a recipe in different places.\nEach piece of the puzzle, or each recipe piece, is responsible for making a different part of the virus.\nBut there’s a challenge.

Though, in some cases, the virus particles are released in a way that causes the cells to burst in a process called lysis - the poliovirus does this.\n\n4.2.1.1 Example: Adenovirus in the Nucleus\n\n\n\n\n\nAssembly of an Adenovirus\n\n\n\n\nAfter the virus uses the host cell’s ribosomes to perform protein synthesis, the proteins need to go back into the nucleus.\nAmong one of many proteins that need to go back to the nucleus is called CA - this depends on another protein called the polypeptide VI protein (i.e., pVI). pVI contains a nuclear localization signal (i.e., NLS) - this is like a passport that allows the protein to gain entry into the cell.\nInside the nucleus, the virus’ capsid forms and the virus’ DNA is put into them. These capsids then get treated by proteases to go from young to mature.\nThe viruses cause the cell to undergo lysis.\n\n\n\n4.2.2 Enveloped Viruses\nThese viruses must get a lipid bilayer (i.e., a layer of fatty acids) when they assemble, and this process can happen anywhere depending on where the virus first assembled.\nThis lipid bilayer also protects the virus from being degraded by the environment.\n\n4.2.2.1 Example: HSV in the Nucleus\n\n\n\n\n\nAssembly of a HSV\n\n\n\n\nThere are four main steps:\n\nThe virus’ capsid forms in the nucleus in a very complicated way.\nThis capsid then goes through the nuclear membrane - this requires two things: a phosphoprotein and a transmembrane protein\nThis capsid is first engulfed by the inner nuclear membrane before it leaves through the outer nuclear membrane.\nThis capsid then gets uptaken by the Golgi membrane.\n\n\n\n\n4.2.3 How Does the Flu Virus Assemble?\n\n\n\n\n\nAssembly of the Influenza Virus\n\n\n\n\nThe influenza virus is different from other RNA viruses as its ribonucleoproteins (i.e., RNPs) need to go from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. This moving is aided by the M and NEP proteins.\nHowever, only the NEP proteins have a nuclear export signal (i.e., NES) that allows it to leave the nucleus. This NES overcomes the NLS that the NP and P proteins have.\nThis NES then goes on to bind to another protein called exportin 1 (i.e., CRM1) - this helps the RNP go into the cytoplasm.\n\n\n4.2.4 Virus Assembly at the Membranes\n\n\n\n\n\nVirus Assembly at the Cellular Membranes\n\n\n\n\nWhen viruses assemble on the cell’s membranes, something known as endosomal sorting complexes (i.e., ESCRT) are needed. These ESCRT complexes help shape the cell’s membrane in a way that allows it to bud away from the cytoplasm.\n\n\n\n\n\nDifferent Membrane Budding Sites\n\n\n\n\nThe above figure shows various locations that a virus can bud from:\n\nThrough the plasma membrane - viruses like the RSV or the influenza virus do this. Secretory vesicles that contain the virus can also be made.\nThrough the internal membranes, like the ER (e.g., the rotavirus), the Golgi apparatus (e.g., the Hataan virus), or the nuclear membranes (e.g., the HSV-1 virus).\n\nIf the virus leaves from the internal membranes, then mature viruses can only be released. In many cases, the glycoproteins that the virus has can influence where budding happens.\n\n\n4.2.5 Modifications of Viral Proteins\nThere are a few ways that viral proteins can be modified - especially during budding:\n\nGlycosylation\n\n\n\n\n\nDifferent Glycosylation Outcomes\n\n\n\n\nWhen glycosylation doesn’t happen, this can interfere with the activity of some viral fusion protein - like the RSV’s F protein. Though, glycosylation can also affect how proteases cleave the influenza virus’ HA protein.\nAttaching Lipids to Viral Proteins\n\n\n\n\n\nAttachment of Palmitoyl Groups to Cysteine Residues\n\n\n\n\nWhen something called palmitoyl is attached to the amino acid cysteine, scientist think that this may help stabilize viral fusion proteins. This typically happens on the carbon terminus of the cysteine residue - this happens on the cytoplasm side of the protein.\nMyristylation - on the other hand - refers to adding something called myristic acid to the nitrogen end of glycine.\nProteolytic Cleavage\nThe reality is that many viral fusion proteins need to be activated by proteases (i.e., proteins that promote degradtion) so that they can perform their functions.\n\n\n\n\n\nEbola Virus’ G Protein Being Cleaved by Furin\n\n\n\n\nA protease called furin and proteases similar to furin can be found in the Golgi apparatus. Furin is found in many cell types and has multiple cleavage sites.\nThere are also cell-specific proteases like the Clara protease. These proteases are typically specific to tissues and only work on single to double amino acids."

There’s something called the raft hypothesis that states that certain areas (i.e., microdomains) of the cell membrane have more types of a specific kind of lipid.\n\n4.3.2.1 Why do Lipid Rafts Form?\nDifferent kinds of lipids in the membranes of an animal’s cell don’t all provide the same stability.\nThat said, virus assembly can occur in these lipid raft microdomains. Many kinds of viruses - including the HIV and influenza virus - tend to use lipid rafts as a way of releasing themselves."

    "text": "5.2 Electron Microscopy\n\n\n\n\n\nA Transmission Electron Microscope and a Scanning Electron Microscope\n\n\n\n\nUsing an electron microscope is a complicated deal and one needs expertise to operate and prepare samples. On one hand, electron microscopes can magnify and show a lot of tiny details, but there’s a downside to this: the microscope works in a vacuum - a space without air - so samples need to be dry.\nScientists use these techniques to see things up close using special labels. They attach tiny gold particles to antibodies, and these antibodies can be seen under the microscope and identify specific parts in the samples that they’re looking at.\n\n5.2.1 Scanning Electron Microscopy (i.e., SEM)\n\n\n\n\n\nExamples of Samples Viewed using Scanning Electron Microscopy\n\n\n\n\nScanning electron microscopy (i.e., SEM) is a method used to look at the outside of cells or bigger parts like viruses. Cells are first treated with something called critical point drying to make sure that they’re ready for the microscope.\n\n\n\n\n\nOutline of How SEM Works\n\n\n\n\nThe above figure outlines how SEM typically works:\n\nFixation\nScientist ensure that the cells or samples are fixed. This is almost like taking a picture to ensure that everything stays still.\nDrying\nWater is removed from the samples. Water can mess up the microscope.\nCritical Point Drying\nThis is akin to freeze-drying, but is a technique that helps keep the samples in a good shape for the microscope.\nCoating\nThe sample is coated with a thin layer of a special material - usually metal - to make the samples stronger and ready for the microscope.\nSEM Analysis\nThe sample is put into a SEM - this microscope uses special light to take a super close-up picture of the samples. Scientists can then study these pictures to know more about what it is that they’re looking at.\n\n\n\n5.2.2 Transmission Electron Microscopy (i.e., TEM)\n\n5.2.2.1 Negative Staining\nNegative staining is a way to look at virus particles, their morphology, and detect viruses in clinical material. In this setup, special heavy metals make the virus parts stand out more. Uranyl acetate and phosphotungstic acid are two common choices; these agents don’t color the virus, but they make them easier to see under an electron microscope.\nScientists also use a special grid to look at the viruses under the electron microscope.\n\n\n\n\n\nOutline of How TEM Works\n\n\n\n\nThe above figure outlines how TEM works:\n\nAdding Sample to Buffer\nSamples are added to a special liquid called a buffer - this helps keep sample safe and ready for the following step.\nAdding Heavy Metal Stain\nA special “paint” made out of heavy metals is added to the sample - this helps the microscope see the sample better by giving it strong contrasts (i.e., like dark ink on white paper).\nBlotting\nThe sample is put onto a special surface that soaks up the extra liquid.\nAir Drying\nThe sample is left in the air to dry. This helps the heavy metal paint to stick to the sample and make it ready for viewing.\n\n\n\n5.2.2.2 Immuno-Negative Staining\nWhen negative staining is performed with immunolabelling, this is called immuno-negative staining. First, immunolabelling - putting special “labels” on the objects of interests - is carried out. Then, negative staining is carried out to make the sample easier to look at.\n\n\n5.2.2.3 Thin Sections\nTo study samples closely, scientists need to prepare them carefully:\n\nFirst, they make the cells stay still using a process called fixation.\nThey treat the cells with chemicals and then remove water from them.\nThey put the cells into a special plastic material to keep them in shape. To see virus-infected cells, they need to cut super thin slices, like cutting very thin pieces of cheese. These slices are usually between 80 and 100 nanometers thick.\nThey use a special machine called an ultramicrotome to do this cutting. Once the slices are ready, they put them on a small grid and add some coloring to help see the details better when they use the electron microscope.\n\nSamples can also be immunolabelled before or after embedding (i.e., keeping the cells into a special plastic material) and sectioning."

    "text": "6.1 Cultivating Viruses\nThree people - John Enders, Thomas Weller, and Frederick Robbins - were able to grow poliovirus particles in human cells.\nWhen it comes to growing viruses, scientists use different types of cell systems:\n\nPrimary Cells\nThese are directly taken from tissues and not repeatedly grown in culture. These cells, like chick embryo fibroblasts (CEF), closely resemble the original tissue, but their preparation can be complex and requires tissue access.\nCell Lines\nThese are cells that have been made immortal through processes like transformation, as seen in Vero cells and MDCK cells. While they are easy to maintain, they might lose some characteristics of the original tissue.\nAnimal Tissues or Structures\nThis may involve tissues or structures from animals, such as using suckling mouse brain for flaviviruses or embryonated eggs for influenza.\n\nThe choice of cell system depends on the virus being studied; for example, MDCK cells are preferred for growing influenza viruses.\nTo gather viruses from an infected host, scientists can collect substances like excretions, secretions, blood, or tissue, and then use these materials to infect cell cultures. The virus obtained from this process is known as a virus isolate.\nSometimes, viruses change to grow better in specific cell lines, leading to genetic modifications associated with adapting to cell cultures. This can be problematic for researchers wanting to study the virus in its natural form (undesirable), but it’s also useful for developing weakened virus vaccines (desirable) since it forms the foundation for making attenuated viral vaccines.\n\n6.1.1 Cytopathic Effect\n\n\n\n\n\nExample of the Cytopathic Effect\n\n\n\n\nWhen viruses infect cultured cells, they can cause different visual changes in the cells’ appearance. These changes are collectively called cytopathic effect or “CPE”. The specific type of CPE can vary depending on the virus and the type of cell it infects.\n\n\n6.1.2 Particle / PFU Ratio\nThe particle or pfu ratio is a comparison between the total number of virus particles and the number of infectious particles, usually measured in plaque forming units (i.e., pfu). In an ideal scenario, this ratio would be 1.0, indicating that all particles are infectious.\nHowever, in real-world situations, this ratio is typically greater than 1.0. For instance, with influenza, this ratio can be around 10, suggesting that not all virus particles are capable of causing infection.\n\n\n6.1.3 Multiplicity of Infection (i.e., MOI)\nThe Multiplicity of Infection (i.e., moi) measures the average amount of infectious virus introduced to each cell. For instance, an moi of 1 means adding 1 pfu per cell. It’s important to determine this for a specific virus stock preparation.\nTo create a virus stock, a low moi is used, usually ranging from 0.01 to 0.1. This helps prevent the creation of defective interfering particles, which would increase the particle/pfu ratio.\nOn the other hand, studies focusing on virus replication use a higher moi, typically between 5 and 10, ensuring that all cells are infected simultaneously. To calculate moi accurately, it’s necessary to know both the cell count and the number of infectious particles being added."

    "section": "6.2 Quantifying Viruses",
    "text": "6.2 Quantifying Viruses\nThere are two main types of assays used to study viruses:\n\nInfectivity assays\nThese tests are designed to measure the presence of infectious virus particles. They determine whether the virus is capable of infecting and replicating within host cells.\nNon-infectivity assays\nThese assays are used to measure the quantity of virus present in a sample, regardless of whether the virus is still capable of causing infection. They provide information about the overall amount of viral material in the sample.\n\n\n6.2.1 Virus Infectivity Assays\n\n6.2.1.1 Plaque Assay\n\n\n\n\n\nResults from a Plaque Assay\n\n\n\n\nThe plaque assay is a technique that exploits the fact that a single infectious virus particle can cause a visible area of damage, like cell death. Here’s how it works:\n\nScientists create serial dilutions of a virus suspension and apply these dilutions to a layer of cells. The cells are then incubated for a specific period, which varies depending on the virus.\nAn overlay is added to the cell layer to restrict the spread of the virus, allowing local virus replication to occur.\nAfter some time, the cells are stained so that the areas of damage, called plaques, become visible to the naked eye.\nEach plaque originates from a single infectious virus particle. This helps researchers count the number of infectious particles in the initial virus suspension.\nDifferent types of cells are used for different viruses. For example, MDCK cells are used for influenza, and HEp2 cells are used for RSV. This is because different viruses interact better with specific cell types.\n\nIn essence, the plaque assay is a method for quantifying the number of infectious virus particles in a sample and allows researchers to study their effects on cells.\nThe plaque assay method can be adapted in various ways to suit specific needs:\n\nDifferent overlay medium\nInstead of using the standard overlay, various substances like agarose, carboxymethyl cellulose (cmc), or avecel can be used. These substances modify how the virus spreads and affects cells.\nDifferent visualization methods for plaques\nPlaques, the visible areas of cell damage, can be detected in diverse ways. This could involve visual observation (noting cell death) or using immunostaining techniques to identify specific viral proteins or markers associated with infected cells. These variations allow researchers to tailor the assay to their objectives and the characteristics of the virus being studied.\n\n\n\n6.2.1.2 Endpoint Assay\nThe endpoint assay is employed when certain viruses don’t create plaques or foci but instead lead to noticeable cytopathic effects (CPE), such as the measles virus on Vero cells.\nHere’s how the endpoint assay works:\n\nReplicates and TCID50\nMultiple repetitions of the assay are conducted using different virus dilutions. The dilution at which 50% of these replicates show CPE is determined. This provides a value known as the TCID50 (50% Tissue Culture Infectious Dose).\nReed and Muench calculation\nTo calculate TCID50, the Reed and Muench method is commonly employed. This involves statistical calculations to estimate the viral concentration based on the observed outcomes in the replicates.\n\nThe endpoint assay is an alternate method for quantifying viral infectivity when plaque formation isn’t applicable. It helps researchers gauge the virus’s impact on cell cultures.\n\n\n\n6.2.2 Other Assays\n\n6.2.2.1 Haemagglutination Assay\n\n\n\n\n\nSchematic of a Haemagglutination Assay\n\n\n\n\nBack in 1941, George Hirst made a significant breakthrough by showing that the influenza virus could clump together red blood cells.\nThis discovery introduced the first quick and quantitative technique for measuring viruses that affect eukaryotic cells. For the first time, it became possible to actually count viruses. This method, which measures the level of influenza virus, is still in use today.\n\n\n6.2.2.2 Direct Particle Count\n\n\n\n\n\nIllustration of a Direct Particle Count\n\n\n\n\nThe direct particle count method involves estimating the quantity of virus particles using electron microscopy. Here’s how it works:\n\nUsing visible markers\nScientists incorporate a known concentration of easily visible markers, like latex beads, into the virus sample.\nElectron microscopy\nThe sample is then examined under an electron microscope, allowing researchers to observe and count both the virus particles and the added markers.\n\nHowever, it’s important to note that this method doesn’t differentiate between infectious and noninfectious virus particles. While it provides a measure of the total number of particles, it doesn’t offer insights into their infectivity."

It’s like studying what happens when you change some parts of a toy.\nTo do this, they aim to create a sort of “genetic blueprint” for the virus, a bit like having a recipe that can make the virus. This blueprint is made of DNA and allows them to generate a virus that can actually infect cells and do its thing.\nFor viruses with positive-strand RNA, it’s quite direct. It’s like having a simple recipe that’s easy to follow.\nHowever, for viruses with negative-strand RNA or other complex types, things get tricky. It’s like having a tricky recipe that’s not easy to understand. Scientists need to figure out ways to work with these viruses, and sometimes it’s quite complicated. In fact, for some viruses, there aren’t even good methods yet.\n\n7.1.1 Genetic Recombination from Cloned DNA\n\n7.1.1.1 Positive Stranded Viruses\n\n\n\n\n\nOverview of Replication Strategy of Positive Stranded Viruses\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.1.1.2 Negative Stranded Viruses\n\n\n\n\n\nOverview of Replication Strategy of Negative Stranded Viruses\n\n\n\n\nSome examples of generating negative stranded RNA viruses via reverse genetics include:\n\nParamyxovirus\nTo get the virus working, it’s like having a team of players. The main players are L (polymerase), P (cofactor), and N (vRNA binder), and they need to work together to do their job.\nTo make this happen, scientists put together a special setup. It’s like gathering the right players for a game. They put bits of genetic instructions for L, P, and N into the cell, just like sending in players to play their roles (i.e., plasmids containing L, P, and N). They also add in the virus’s complete instructions.\nImagine it’s like getting the team’s players and the playbook ready to start the game.\nInfluenza Virus\n\n\n\n\n\nAppearance of a Flu Virus\n\n\n\n\nImagine the Influenza virus as a set of building blocks, but instead of having all the instructions on one block, they spread them out on different blocks. It’s like having different pages of a recipe in separate books.\nIn the case of the Influenza A virus, it’s like having 8 different books, each with its own set of instructions for making different parts of the virus.\nTo build the virus, certain blocks have special jobs. Think of these blocks as the leaders of the construction team. There are four blocks named NP, PB1, PB2, and PA. These four work together like a powerful team to make the virus’s “building crew,” kind of like a mastermind group.\n\n\n\n\n7.1.2 12 Plasmid System\n\n\n\n\n\n12 Plasmid System\n\n\n\n\nWhen scientists want to make a virus do something, it’s like giving it a job to perform. They use special “worker molecules” called RNA pol1 or pol2, kind of like having different teams for different tasks.\nNow, here comes an interesting point. Imagine the virus’s instructions are like puzzle pieces. For some viruses with many pieces (segments), scientists need more instruction cards (plasmids) to complete the puzzle. Think of it like needing more recipe cards to make a big meal.\nCurrently, for some viruses, scientists need around 12 or 8 of these special cards (i.e., plasmids) to make the virus work properly. It’s like needing a lot of recipe cards to make a complex dish.\n\n\n7.1.3 Applications\nUsually, flu vaccines are made using eggs. It’s like using eggs as tiny factories to create the vaccine.\nBut there’s a challenge. The H5N1 virus is a bit tricky. It’s really strong and can cause problems in the labs where it’s grown, which is like a high-security zone. Because it’s so strong, it even harms the eggs used to grow it, like breaking the eggs you want to use for cooking.\nBecause of this, the amount of virus that can be grown is limited. It’s like not having enough ingredients to make a big batch of food.\n\n\n\n\n\n12 Plasmid System to Generate H5N1 Virus Particles\n\n\n\n\nWhen there’s a tricky virus like H5N1 that’s causing problems, scientists use reverse genetics. It’s like solving a puzzle backwards.\nThey create a new virus that’s safe and not very risky. This new virus can also grow well in eggs, like the ones they use for making vaccines."
