    "text": "Antivirus drugs are essential tools in the fight against infectious diseases. They serve two main purposes: managing outbreaks and treating or preventing virus infections.\nIn the first scenario, antivirus drugs are used to manage outbreaks, especially during pandemics. Let’s take the example of the influenza virus pandemic. These drugs are administered to key individuals, such as healthcare workers, to control the spread of the virus until vaccines become available. Essentially, antivirus drugs help keep the situation under control when we’re waiting for vaccines to be ready.\nIn the second scenario, antivirus drugs are used to treat or prevent virus infections when vaccines are not effective or appropriate. For instance, some viruses like HIV-1 can be tricky to develop effective vaccines for, and some patients with HIV-1 are immunocompromised. In such cases, antivirus drugs are crucial in managing the infection. Additionally, there are viruses like RSV and HIV for which vaccines are not available, making antivirus drugs the primary line of defense in these situations. These drugs are a vital tool in protecting individuals from these viruses when no vaccine is at hand.\nFirstly, scientists can target each step in the virus life cycle. Viruses have a specific sequence of events they follow when infecting a host, and we can develop treatments that disrupt these steps. This disrupts the virus’s ability to replicate and spread.\nSecondly, there’s a complex relationship between the virus and the host organism it infects. This connection is intricate and plays a significant role in how a virus operates. By studying this relationship, researchers can find weaknesses they can exploit to combat the virus effectively.\nHowever, there’s a challenge in developing treatments - selectivity and toxicity. While we want treatments to target the virus, we also want to avoid harming the host organism. Striking the right balance between being selective against the virus and avoiding toxicity to the host can be a tricky task.\nTo tackle these challenges, we need a deeper understanding of how viruses interact with their host. The more we know about these interactions, the better equipped we are to develop treatments that specifically target the virus while minimizing harm to the host. In essence, gaining greater insights into virus-host interactions is critical for improving the way we combat viral infections."

    "section": "5.1 General Considerations Behind Virus Drug Development",
    "text": "5.1 General Considerations Behind Virus Drug Development\nThere are some general considerations when it comes to antivirus drugs:\nFirstly, each virus has its own set of specific proteins. This means that antivirus drugs need to be specifically designed to target the particular virus they’re meant to combat. They can’t be one-size-fits-all.\nSecondly, some viruses can go into a latent or dormant state within the body. In these cases, antivirus drugs might not completely cure the infection, but they can help manage the symptoms and reduce the virus’s activity.\nIt’s also important to note that early treatment is often crucial for the effectiveness of antivirus drugs. For example, drugs like Tamiflu work best when administered early in the course of an infection.\nHowever, there can be challenges related to the pharmaceutical industry, particularly in terms of drug development. Developing drugs, especially for diseases like Ebola, can be expensive. The potential market for these drugs might not be as large, which can deter pharmaceutical companies from investing in research and development.\nCost is a significant issue, especially in developing countries. While some antivirus drugs, like the human monoclonal antibody against RSV (Respiratory Syncytial Virus), can be highly effective, their expense makes them less accessible in regions with limited resources. So, finding ways to make these drugs more affordable is a critical concern, as everyone should have access to effective treatments regardless of their location or financial means.\n\n5.1.1 Strategies for Antivirus Drugs\nNote that all three strategies shown here can all be used with one another.\n\n5.1.1.1 Testing Specific Drugs\nFirstly, scientists test specific drugs to see if they can stop or inhibit the replication of a virus. For instance, a drug like amantadine may be examined for its antiviral properties.\nIt’s worth noting that the discovery of these antiviral activities is often serendipitous, meaning that researchers sometimes stumble upon these properties while studying a drug for another purpose.\nOnce a drug shows promise, further evaluation is necessary. This involves understanding the mechanism of action, which is how the drug works against the virus. This knowledge is crucial for optimizing its effectiveness.\nA significant concern in the development and use of antivirus drugs is the potential for drug resistance to develop. Viruses can adapt and become less susceptible to the effects of a drug, reducing its efficacy over time. This is an ongoing challenge in the field of antiviral drug development.\nFinally, there’s the concept of drug repurposing. This means taking existing drugs that were originally designed for a different purpose and discovering that they have antiviral properties. This approach can save time and resources compared to developing entirely new drugs from scratch.\n\n\n5.1.1.2 Rational Approaches\nIn the world of antiviral drug development, there are two main approaches: the rational approach and the cell-based approach. Let’s break down what these mean.\nThe rational approach is like a detective work where scientists search for clues to create drugs that can fight viruses. They use a method called high-throughput screening to identify specific parts of the virus that they can target. Imagine it like finding the weak spots of a villain. In this case, they look for a viral gene product, which is a tiny piece of the virus. To create a drug, they often need to purify a protein or a group of proteins. These drugs work by blocking the bad things the virus proteins do. They even have fancy machines, like robots, to help them quickly test lots of drugs. For example, they found drugs like nevirapine to fight HIV1.\nOn the other hand, the cell-based approach is a bit different. It’s like a big experiment where scientists use whole cells to test drugs. This approach is usually slower and can be a bit tricky and costly. However, it lets scientists explore many different parts of the virus at once. They even have special machines that can do this, like robotic systems with viruses that light up, sort of like a virus disco. With this approach, they found drugs like PA-457 to fight HIV by stopping the virus from growing up.\n\n\n5.1.1.3 Structure-Based Approaches\nIn the world of creating antivirus drugs, there’s a cool approach called the structure-based approach. It’s like having a superpower that lets scientists see the virus in 3D, just like in a video game. Let’s break down what that means.\nWith this approach, scientists can figure out the three-dimensional (3D) shape of the virus’s proteins. It’s kind of like having a detailed map of the virus. This map allows scientists to zoom in and see the tiny, important parts of the virus proteins super up close, like using a microscope that shows things at the atomic level.\nNow, with this powerful 3D map, scientists can understand how the virus works on a biochemical level. It’s like knowing the secret moves of a video game character. They can use this knowledge to design medicines that can stop the virus in its tracks. One example is a medicine called Zanamivir, which fights the flu virus by targeting a part of the virus called neuraminidase.\nSo, the structure-based approach is like having a superhero vision that lets scientists see the virus in 3D. This helps them design smart medicines that can defeat the virus, just like a hero taking down a villain in a video game.\n\n\n\n5.1.2 Developing Hits\nIn the quest to find antiviral drugs, scientists use different methods to discover a promising candidate, which they call a hit. These “hits” are substances that show some level of effectiveness in fighting a virus. However, just finding a “hit” isn’t enough. Scientists need to turn this “hit” into a powerful drug with high potency and qualities that make it safe and easy to use, like taking it as a pill or making sure it doesn’t have harmful effects in the body.\nThe properties of an antiviral drug can influence how it’s used in patients. For example, think of medicines like Tamiflu, which you can take as a pill, or Zanamivir, which comes as an aerosol spray, or Peramivir, which is given through an IV. These differences matter because they affect how patients receive the treatment.\nOther important things to consider are the market and patents. The availability of a drug, along with its patents (like exclusive rights to make and sell it), can impact its use and availability.\nOnce a “hit” is found and turned into a good drug with the right qualities, it’s ready for clinical trials. These are like big tests to see if the drug works well and is safe for patients. But there’s always a concern about the drug’s toxicity, meaning how harmful it might be. Many antiviral drugs can have side effects, which are like unwanted consequences. Scientists need to find a balance between the benefits of the drug and any costs, like the nausea that amantadine can cause versus the protection it offers against H5N1 infection."

    "section": "5.2 Drug Actions",
    "text": "5.2 Drug Actions\n\n5.2.1 Virus Attachment and Entry\n\n\n\n\n\nAttachment of a Virus to Gain Entry into a Cell\n\n\n\n\nDrugs can help target viruses’ entries into the cell (to cause an infection). This is a mechanism that is targeted by many treatments (e.g., Zanamivir).\n\n5.2.1.1 Fusion Inhibitors\n\n\n\n\n\nExample of a Fusion Inhibitor at Play\n\n\n\n\nLet’s dive into the fascinating world of fusion inhibitors, with a specific example called Enfurirtide, or T20 for short. These inhibitors are like the bouncers at the door of a club, stopping viruses from getting in.\nScientists discovered fusion inhibitors, like T20, when they were testing tiny pieces called peptides to see if they could stop the HIV1 virus from infecting cells in a lab dish.\nHere’s the trick: when HIV1 tries to sneak into a cell, it has to bind with something called gp120, like a key fitting into a lock. This connection sets off a change in shape, a bit like a transformer turning into a different form. This change lets two parts, HR1 and HR2, start interacting. It’s this interaction that helps the virus fuse with the cell’s membrane.\nNow, T20 comes in and plays the hero. It binds to HR1 on a different part called gp41 and says, “No way, you’re not coming in!” By blocking this interaction between HR1 and HR2, T20 prevents the virus from joining forces with the cell. Essentially, it stops the virus from fusing with the cell’s outer covering, like a locked door.\n\n\n5.2.1.2 Cell Surface Receptors\n\n\n\n\n\nMaraviroc Mechanism\n\n\n\n\nLet’s talk about CCR5 and its role in HIV1 infection. CCR5 is like a key that the HIV1 virus needs to enter some types of human cells. Maraviroc is a kind of drug that prohibits HIV1 from getting into a cell by binding to the CCR5 primary receptor (though the virus can also get in using the CXCR4 receptor - this drug needs to be checked for its effectiveness).\n\n\n\n\n\nEntry of the HIV1 Virus into a Cell\n\n\n\n\nScientists figured out that CCR5 is crucial for the virus to get a foothold in the body. They used animal models, which are sort of like test subjects in the lab, to show that CCR5 is essential for the virus to start an infection.\nBut guess what? Scientists found a way to block CCR5 and stop the virus in its tracks. They used something natural called RANTES, which is like a superhero protein that can lock CCR5 and keep it from letting HIV1 in. This is a bit like changing the lock on a door so that the old key doesn’t work.\nThere are other things like TAK-779 that also block CCR5 by preventing RANTES from binding to it. They’re like additional locks on the door.\nAnd then there’s PRO 140, which is like a special antibody created to fight against CCR5. The great thing about PRO 140 is that it doesn’t lead to multi-drug resistance (which is when the virus gets smarter and figures out how to get in) or direct toxic effects in the body. It’s a friendly defender against the virus.\n\n\n\n5.2.2 Uncoating\n\n\n\n\n\nAmantadine Mechanism in Preventing Influenza Virus Uncoating\n\n\n\n\nLet’s explore what happens after a virus attaches to and enters a cell. After this sneak attack, some viruses need to uncoat themselves to release their genetic material, which is like the virus’s secret code. This uncoating step is crucial for the virus to take control of the cell.\nBut, here’s where our heroes, drugs like Amantadine and Rimantadine (Symmetrel and Flumadine, respectively), come into play. These drugs are like the bouncers at a club, preventing the virus from getting into the party.\nAmantadine and Rimantadine target a specific part called the M2 ion channel. Think of it like the virus’s entry gate. The M2 protein is responsible for forming a tiny channel that’s picky about the protons (charged particles) it lets in.\nNow, here’s the clever part: Amantadine binds to certain sequences within the M2 protein’s channel, specifically in its transmembrane region. It’s like putting a plug in the drain to stop water from flowing. Scientists discovered this by studying the virus’s resistance to the drug, which is like figuring out how to get past a locked door.\n\n5.2.2.1 How Does Amantadine Work?\n\n\n\n\n\nAmantaine’s Mechanism\n\n\n\n\nLet’s continue our exploration of Amantadine’s superhero powers in the fight against viruses. Now, we’ll look at how it works at a molecular level.\nRemember how we talked about the M2 protein forming a channel for protons (charged particles)? Well, this channel leads to an increase in the acid levels inside the virus, and that’s like the alarm going off. This acidity causes the virus’s genetic material (the RNP) to separate from another important part called M1.\nHere’s where Amantadine steps in as the hero. It blocks the proton channel’s activity, like shutting off the alarm system. By doing this, it prevents the increase in acidity. As a result, the RNP and M1 can’t detach from each other, which is a crucial part of the uncoating process. In simpler terms, Amantadine stops the virus from unpacking its secret code.\nBut, viruses can be clever too. They sometimes develop resistance to Amantadine. This happens when the virus mutates, which means its genetic makeup changes. In this case, it’s a mutation in the transmembrane domain (a part of the M2 protein) that forms the pore. This mutation prevents Amantadine from binding to the M2 protein and blocking its activity. One example of this resistant mutation is called S31N.\nSo, Amantadine is like the guardian of the virus’s uncoating process, blocking the proton channel and keeping the virus’s genetic material under wraps. However, the virus can sometimes outsmart Amantadine by changing its genetic code. This constant battle between viruses and drugs keeps scientists on their toes in the fight against infections.\n\n\n\n5.2.3 Genome Replication\n\n5.2.3.1 Nucleoside Inhibitors\nLet’s explore how nucleoside inhibitors work in the battle against viruses. These inhibitors are like undercover agents trying to confuse the virus’s genetic machinery.\nNucleoside inhibitors mimic something called nucleoside monophosphates. Think of them as sneaky impostors that pretend to be part of the virus’s genetic code. But there’s a catch – they need to be activated first. To activate them, they go through a process called phosphorylation, which is like putting on their disguise.\nOnce these inhibitors are activated, they compete with the virus’s natural building blocks called dNTPs. It’s like a race, and the inhibitors want to win. They block the dNTPs from joining the growing viral genetic material.\nAs a result, the viral DNA chain, which is like a long, spiraling ladder, gets stuck. The inhibitors act like a roadblock and stop the ladder from growing. This termination of elongation prevents the virus from making more copies of itself, which is a big win in the fight against infections.\n\n5.2.3.1.1 Acyclovir\n\n\n\n\n\nAcyclovir Mode of Action\n\n\n\n\nLet’s dive into the world of antiviral drugs, specifically how a drug called ACV (acyclovir) works against herpes viruses like HSV. ACV is like a secret agent with a unique mission.\nACV has a part that’s like a guanine base, which is a building block for the virus’s genetic material, attached to a sugar-like molecule. It’s this special structure that makes ACV effective against herpes viruses.\nIn the world of herpes, there’s a key player called thymidine kinase, or TK for short. TK is involved in making the virus’s DNA. When ACV enters an HSV-infected cell, TK recognizes it and does something called phosphorylation. This is like giving ACV a secret code that activates its power.\nHere’s the clever part: while both HSV-infected and non-infected cells have TK, only the TK in HSV-infected cells can efficiently give ACV that secret code. As a result, HSV-infected cells have about 100 times more phosphorylated ACV than non-infected cells.\nThis is where the magic of selectivity comes in. The drug ACV targets the virus specifically because only in infected cells does it get that secret code. It’s like a lock and key that fits perfectly in the virus but not in healthy cells.\nSo, ACV is like a smart secret agent that can infiltrate the virus’s world with a special key, thanks to the unique abilities of TK. This selectivity is the secret to its success in fighting herpes infections.\n\n5.2.3.1.1.1 More on Acyclovir\nLet’s take a closer look at how ACV (acyclovir) puts a stop to the replication of the virus’s genetic material. ACV acts like a roadblock in the virus’s path.\n\n\n\n\n\nACY Complex Inhibiting Herpes Virus Replication\n\n\n\n\nFirst, ACV needs to undergo a series of transformations. It starts as ACV and gets phosphorylated by a cellular enzyme called thymidine kinase, turning into ACV-monophosphate (ACV-MP). Then, another enzyme, called guanosine monophosphate kinase, adds a phosphate group, transforming it into ACV-diphosphate (ACV-DP). Afterward, more cellular enzymes chip in to make it into ACV-triphosphate (ACV-TP). This transformation process is like getting the right outfit and gear for a special mission.\nNow, ACV-TP is ready to do its job. It acts like a double agent, pretending to be a building block for the virus’s genetic material. When the virus is replicating its DNA, it needs certain building blocks, one of which is dGTP. ACV-TP steps in and competes with dGTP for a spot in the growing DNA chain.\nThe virus’s DNA polymerase, the worker responsible for building the DNA, grabs ACV-TP instead of dGTP. It starts to add ACV-TP to the DNA chain. But here’s the clever part: the moment ACV-TP is in place, the DNA polymerase can’t move forward. That’s because there’s no 3’OH (a chemical group) on ACV-TP, which is needed for the DNA-building process to continue.\nThis interruption in the DNA chain elongation is like a roadblock on the virus’s path. It stops the virus from making more copies of itself and helps put an end to the infection.\n\n\n\n5.2.3.1.2 Nucleoside Analogues\n\n\n\n\n\nExamples of Nucleotide Analogues\n\n\n\n\nNow, let’s explore some exciting developments in antiviral drugs inspired by ACV (acyclovir). These drugs aim to enhance certain aspects of ACV’s effectiveness.\nOne of these new drugs is Valacyclovir, which is like an upgraded version of ACV. Valacyclovir is better absorbed by the body compared to ACV, meaning it gets to work more efficiently. This improved absorption is referred to as “bioavailability.” It’s like making a medicine that’s not only strong but also gets to the right places in the body faster, like a speedier messenger on a mission.\nAnother pair of drugs, Ganciclovir and Valganciclovir, have shown promise in fighting the Human Cytomegalovirus (HCMV). This is interesting because ACV isn’t very effective against HCMV. Ganciclovir and Valganciclovir are like new recruits in the battle against HCMV. They target a different part of the virus called UL97, which ACV doesn’t tackle well.\nThese developments are like adding new weapons to the arsenal against viral infections. Valacyclovir ensures that the medicine is absorbed better, while Ganciclovir and Valganciclovir offer a more effective strategy against a virus that ACV struggles to combat. It’s all about fine-tuning our approach to fight different viruses with the right tools.\n\n\n5.2.3.1.3 Zidovudine (AZT)\n\n\n\n\n\nStructure of Zidovudine\n\n\n\n\nHIV, the virus responsible for AIDS, has a sneaky trick up its sleeve. It carries its genetic information in the form of RNA, but it needs to convert this RNA into DNA to take control of human cells. This conversion is like turning a script into a movie, and it’s made possible by a special enzyme called HIV reverse transcriptase (RT).\nHere’s the interesting part: HIV RT is different from the cellular polymerases found in our body, which are like the workers that build and repair our genetic material. This uniqueness makes HIV RT an excellent target for drugs, like a weak point in the virus’s armor.\nOne such drug is Zidovudine (also known as AZT). AZT is a type of drug called a nucleoside analogue. It mimics the building blocks of DNA and RNA. When the virus tries to copy its genetic material, it grabs AZT instead of the real building block. This leads to mistakes in the viral DNA, disrupting its ability to replicate accurately.\nFor patients with HIV, AZT had a significant impact, at least in the short term. It helped reduce the mortality rate among HIV-infected patients, offering a ray of hope in the battle against this challenging virus.\n\n5.2.3.1.3.1 Zidovudine’s Mode of Action\n\n\n\n\n\nMode of Action of Zidovudine\n\n\n\n\nLet’s break down the process of how AZT (zidovudine) works as an antiviral drug, specifically targeting HIV. Think of this as understanding the steps in a crucial battle against the virus.\n\nAZT is initially converted by a cellular enzyme called thymidine kinase (TK) into AZT-monophosphate (AZT-MP). This conversion is like preparing a specialized tool for a specific job.\nAZT-MP is then further modified to AZT-diphosphate (AZT-DP) by another cellular enzyme called thymidylate kinase. It’s like upgrading the tool to be more effective.\nThe final transformation occurs when AZT-DP is converted to AZT-triphosphate (AZT-TP) by a cellular enzyme called nucleoside diphosphate kinase. This is like giving the tool its ultimate form, ready to do its job with full force.\n\nNow, AZT-TP, in its triphosphate form, is a potent substrate for the HIV reverse transcriptase (RT), the enzyme crucial for HIV replication. It’s like a master key that can unlock the virus’s secrets. When AZT-TP is incorporated into the growing viral DNA chain, it acts like a stop sign, terminating the DNA elongation process. This halts the virus’s ability to replicate and spread.\nHowever, there’s a catch. While AZT-TP is effective against HIV, it can accumulate not only in infected cells but also in healthy cells. This accumulation can lead to toxicity, which is like a side effect of the battle. Balancing the benefits of stopping HIV with the potential toxicity is a critical consideration in the use of AZT.\n\n\n\n\n5.2.3.2 Non-Nucleotide Inhibitors\nNucleoside analogue inhibitors, like AZT (zidovudine), can be effective against viruses, but they come with a challenge. They can also inhibit cellular enzymes, which can lead to unwanted side effects. It’s like trying to hit a specific target but accidentally hitting something else in the process.\nTo address this issue, scientists have worked on developing drugs that can inhibit viral polymerases through a different mechanism. One such drug is Foscarnet. This drug is like a secret agent with a unique mission.\n\n\n\n\n\nSite of Activity of Foscaranet\n\n\n\n\nFoscarnet is an analogue of pyrophosphate, a molecule that plays a role in DNA replication. What makes Foscarnet special is that it directly inhibits the viral polymerase by binding to a specific region of the protein that is normally occupied by pyrophosphate. It’s like infiltrating the enemy’s stronghold and disrupting their command center.\nBy doing this, Foscarnet prevents the normal release of pyrophosphate during viral DNA replication. This interference is highly selective, as it targets the viral polymerase while sparing cellular enzymes. It’s like using a precision tool to disarm the enemy without causing harm to innocent bystanders.\nFoscarnet’s unique mechanism of action makes it a valuable weapon against certain viruses. It can even be used to treat infections caused by a virus that has developed resistance to other drugs, such as ACV-resistant CMV (cytomegalovirus).\n\n\n\n\n\nMore Examples of Non-Nucleoside Inhibitors\n\n\n\n\nNon-Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors (NNRTIs), which include medications like efavirenz, nevirapine, and delavirdine. These drugs are like skilled marksmen in the fight against the virus.\nNNRTIs are highly specific, meaning they are designed to precisely target and inhibit a specific enzyme in the HIV virus called reverse transcriptase (RT). The beauty of NNRTIs is that they can accomplish this at very low concentrations without affecting our own cellular DNA polymerase, which is responsible for our own DNA replication. It’s like having a sniper that can pinpoint the enemy without hitting innocent bystanders.\nWhat’s fascinating about NNRTIs is that they directly inhibit HIV’s reverse transcriptase. This enzyme is essential for the virus to convert its RNA genetic material into DNA, a key step in the replication process. By interfering with this process, NNRTIs prevent HIV from making copies of itself, essentially stopping its replication dead in its tracks. It’s like cutting off the virus’s supply lines.\n\n5.2.3.2.1 Site of Action\n\n\n\n\n\nSite of Action of NNRTIs\n\n\n\n\nNNRTIs have a specific target within HIV-1, and that’s a region near the active site of the virus’s reverse transcriptase enzyme. This region is essential for the enzyme’s function, much like the core of a lock. NNRTIs are like a unique key designed to fit this specific lock.\nInterestingly, NNRTIs don’t inhibit the binding of dNTP (nucleotide building blocks) to the enzyme, which is crucial for DNA synthesis. Instead, they slow down the incorporation of dNTP into the newly synthesized DNA molecule. It’s as if they are slowing down the process of adding new pieces to the viral genetic code.\nMoreover, NNRTIs block conformational changes in the polymerase structure, which are essentially shape-shifts that the enzyme undergoes during its function. These shape-shifts are crucial for the enzyme’s activity. By blocking these changes, NNRTIs disrupt the functioning of the enzyme, making it unable to perform its job effectively.\n\n\n\n5.2.3.3 Ribavarin (i.e., Virazole)\n\n\n\n\n\nStructure of Ribavarin\n\n\n\n\nRibavirin is like a secret agent with a clever disguise. Its ribose sugar moiety is attached to a base, making it look like a purine, which is a building block of genetic material. This disguise allows it to interfere with the genetic replication process of many different viruses.\nIn laboratory settings (in vitro) and in living organisms (in vivo), Ribavirin has shown its ability to exhibit antiviral activity. It’s like a vigilant guard that can fend off various intruders.\nWhat’s fascinating is that Ribavirin can be a team player. It can be used in combination with other drugs to enhance its antiviral effects. This cooperative approach is like different warriors joining forces to protect a kingdom.\nRibavirin has received approval for use against specific viruses, such as the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections. It’s like a hero receiving recognition for saving lives.\nTo become effective against viruses, Ribavirin undergoes a transformation within our cells. Cellular adenosine kinase plays a crucial role in converting Ribavirin into Ribavirin-monophosphate. This conversion is like preparing Ribavirin for its antiviral mission.\n\n\n\n\n\nPossible Modes of Action of Ribavarin\n\n\n\n\nThe thing about Ribavarin is that nobody really knows how it works. However, scientists have thought of the following:\n\nOne theory is that Ribavirin inhibits an enzyme called inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase. This action results in a reduction of the pools of guanosine triphosphate (GTP) within the cell. GTP is essential for various cellular processes, and by decreasing its levels, Ribavirin may hinder the virus’s ability to replicate. It’s like cutting off a vital supply line for the virus.\nThere’s another hypothesis suggesting that Ribavirin might inhibit RNA polymerase, an enzyme that plays a key role in viral RNA replication. If true, this inhibition would directly impede the virus’s ability to copy its genetic material, like putting a wrench in the gears of a machine.\nAnother intriguing possibility is that Ribavirin could induce an error catastrophe. This means it might increase the mutation rate of the virus beyond a certain threshold, resulting in a reduced number of functional virus genomes. It’s like introducing chaos into the virus’s genetic code, making it less able to produce effective copies of itself.\nRibavirin might also have immunomodulatory effects. It could impact the signaling pathways related to interferon, a critical component of the immune response. By altering these pathways, Ribavirin might enhance the immune system’s ability to combat the virus. It’s like giving a boost to the body’s defenders.\n\n\n\n\n5.2.4 Assembly and Maturation\nVirus assembly and virus maturation are two separate but closely related processes. It’s like building a complex structure where each step has a unique role, but they are all interconnected.\nWhat makes these processes particularly interesting is that they offer attractive targets for antiviral drugs. These targets exist because of the unique features of the assembly and maturation processes. It’s like identifying vulnerabilities in the enemy’s defenses.\nIn many cases, virus assembly and maturation don’t just result in the formation of new virus particles. They also have a significant impact on cellular processes within the host organism. It’s like the virus’s activities causing ripples throughout the cellular landscape.\nTo develop effective drugs that target virus assembly and maturation, we need a deep understanding of the biology of the specific virus in question. It’s like studying the enemy’s tactics to develop a strategic advantage.\n\n5.2.4.1 HIV Protease Inhibitors\n\n\n\n\n\nStructure of the HIV Protease Inhibitor\n\n\n\n\nThe HIV protease is a key player in the virus’s infectivity. It’s an enzyme that plays a vital role in processing viral proteins, which is essential for HIV to become infectious. Think of it as the virus’s master chef responsible for cutting and preparing the ingredients it needs to replicate.\nThis enzyme is a symmetrical homodimer, meaning it consists of two identical parts. Each part contributes to the enzyme’s active site, where the magic happens. It’s like having two skilled hands working in harmony.\nWhen we look closely at the HIV protease, we see three main features: the active site, flaps, and the dimerization domain. The active site is where the enzyme carries out its precise protein-cutting tasks. The flaps are like security guards that control access to the active site, keeping it secure. The dimerization domain ensures that the two halves of the enzyme work together, creating a powerful and coordinated force.\nHIV protease inhibitors are like puzzle pieces that fit perfectly into the active site, disrupting the enzyme’s function. By blocking this key enzyme, these drugs interfere with the virus’s ability to process its proteins, ultimately inhibiting its replication. It’s like disabling the master chef, making it impossible for the virus to prepare its infectious ingredients.\n\n\n\n\n\nIllustration of the Viral Gag Protein\n\n\n\n\nThe viral gag polypeptide acts as the substrate for the HIV protease. When the virus buds, the protease’s job is to cleave this polyprotein into its constituent proteins. This process is essential for the virus to mature and become infectious. Think of it as the protease being the master chef, meticulously preparing the ingredients for the virus’s replication.\nTo disrupt this crucial step in the virus’s life cycle, many protease inhibitors are designed as peptidomimetic inhibitors. These inhibitors mimic the structure of the natural substrates that the protease would normally cleave. Two examples of such inhibitors are Saquinavir and Ritonavir.\n\n\n\n\n\n3D Structure of an Inhibitor and the Gag Polyprotein\n\n\n\n\nRitonavir, in particular, has an interesting mechanism. It binds to the protease and causes its “flaps” to adopt a closed conformation. These flaps are like the security gates guarding the active site of the enzyme. When they’re closed, the active site is inaccessible, and the protease can’t function properly. It’s like putting a lock on the chef’s kitchen, preventing any further preparation of the virus’s components.\n\n5.2.4.1.1 Drug Resistance\nHIV has a remarkable ability to develop resistance to antiviral drugs, including protease inhibitors. It’s like the virus’s way of adapting and evolving in response to the threat. When the virus is exposed to a particular inhibitor, it can develop specific mutations that allow it to resist the drug’s effects. These mutations can affect the protease enzyme and its interaction with the inhibitor.\nWhat’s intriguing is that different inhibitors tend to select for different resistance mutations. It’s like each inhibitor has its unique “weak points” in the virus’s armor, and the virus adapts accordingly. However, the good news is that resistance to one inhibitor doesn’t necessarily mean resistance to all of them. It’s like the virus’s defenses may work against one type of attack but not another.\n\n\n\n5.2.4.2 Hepatitis C Virus (i.e., HCV) Protease Inhibitors\n\n\n\n\n\nStructure of the HCV Genome\n\n\n\n\nThe HCV genome, like a set of instructions, is translated as a single, long polyprotein. This polyprotein is like a recipe that needs to be prepared to make the virus functional.\nTo help with this process, HCV has a key player called NS3/4A. Think of NS3/4A as a skilled chef in the virus’s kitchen. This enzyme is responsible for processing the polyprotein, breaking it down into its individual components. It’s like chopping and preparing the ingredients to create a delicious dish.\n\n\n\n\n\nExamples of HCV Inhibitors\n\n\n\n\nOne such drug is Simeprevir, which is designed to inhibit the HCV NS3/4A protease. Think of it as a key that fits perfectly into the protease’s lock, preventing it from performing its chopping and processing tasks. By blocking the protease’s function, Simeprevir interrupts the virus’s recipe for replication.\nWhat’s fascinating is that there’s a range of protease inhibitors available, each with its unique way of targeting the NS3-4A protease. It’s like having an assortment of tools to dismantle a complex machine. These inhibitors work by binding to the protease and disrupting its activity.\nBy inhibiting the NS3-4A protease, these drugs hinder the virus’s ability to process its polyprotein, rendering it incomplete and non-infectious. This is a vital step in managing HCV and preventing its spread.\n\n\n\n\n\nRecommendation Therapies for HCV Genotypes\n\n\n\n\nTo effectively combat HCV, specific drugs are often prescribed based on the genotype of the virus.\nFor instance, a drug called Simeprevir is indicated for treating HCV genotypes 1 and 4. It’s like having different keys for different locks, and Simeprevir is the right key for these particular genotypes. To make the treatment even more potent, Simeprevir is used in combination with other medications like pegylated-interferon (alfa) and ribavirin.\nThis tailored approach is crucial because different HCV genotypes may respond differently to treatment. It’s like using the right tool for the job. By matching the appropriate drug to the specific genotype, healthcare providers can maximize the effectiveness of treatment and improve the chances of clearing the virus.\n\n\n\n5.2.5 Egress and Release\n\n\n\n\n\nRelease of the Influenza Virus\n\n\n\n\nThis stage is all about the virus’s exit strategy, ensuring that the newly created virus particles can go on to infect new cells.\nThink of it as the virus’s grand finale, where it makes its grand exit from the host cell. This is a crucial step because it determines the virus’s fate and its ability to continue spreading.\nDuring egress and release, the virus is released from the host cell, often by bursting it open. It’s like a prison break, where the virus escapes to seek out new cells to infect. These newly released virus particles are often referred to as “progeny viruses” because they are the next generation of viruses ready to continue the cycle.\nThe success of this stage is vital for the virus’s survival and its ability to infect new cells. Understanding the mechanisms behind egress and release is essential for developing antiviral strategies that can disrupt this stage, thereby preventing the virus from spreading and causing infection in the host.\n\n5.2.5.1 Neuraminidase Inhibitors\n\n\n\n\n\nNeuraminidase Inhibitors in Play\n\n\n\n\nIn the virus world, sialic acid is like a key that the virus uses to unlock the door to new host cells. During the egress phase, when newly formed virus particles are ready to leave the host cell and infect others, they are associated with their sialic acid receptors. It’s like a virus packing its bags for a journey.\nThis is where neuraminidase (NA) comes into play. Neuraminidase is an enzyme that acts as a pair of scissors, cutting the sialic acid “key” from the surface of the host cell. This cleaving action allows the newly formed virus particles to detach and be released into the surrounding environment.\nBut what happens if there’s no neuraminidase? In this case, the virus particles remain tethered to the cell membrane, like a ship anchored to the dock. They cannot be released, which means they can’t spread to new cells and continue their infectious journey.\nNeuraminidase inhibitors are like locks that prevent these scissors from working. By blocking neuraminidase, these drugs keep the sialic acid “keys” intact, preventing the virus from leaving the host cell. This interruption in the egress process is a powerful strategy for stopping the virus from spreading.\n\n\n\n\n\nStructure of the NA Receptor\n\n\n\n\nUnderstanding the structure of neuraminidase (NA) with a cleaved substrate in its active site was a significant breakthrough. It’s like having a detailed map of a critical part of the virus’s machinery. This knowledge allowed scientists to design something called a sialic acid transition state analogue.\nThink of this analogue as a perfectly crafted key that fits precisely into the lock of the NA’s active site. It occupies the space where the virus’s target, the sialic acid, would normally be. By taking up this space, the transition state analogue effectively blocks the NA’s scissors from cutting the sialic acid.\nThe result is a powerful inhibitor of influenza neuraminidase. These inhibitors work against both influenza A and B, which is fantastic because it broadens their effectiveness. It’s like having a master key that can unlock many doors.\n\n5.2.5.1.1 Zanamivir\nZanamivir was one of the first neuraminidase inhibitors to be developed. It’s like an early superhero in the fight against the flu. However, it has a limitation—it needs to be administered as an aerosol. This means you have to inhale it, which can be a bit cumbersome for some people. It’s like having a powerful weapon, but it’s not always easy to use.\nOn the other hand, we have Oseltamivir (Os), which brought some improvements to the table. This drug has better pharmacokinetic properties, including oral bioavailability. It’s like a superhero with a more versatile suit that can be taken as a pill.\nBut here’s an interesting twist: Oseltamivir is a pro-drug. It means that when you take it, your body needs to do a bit of processing to activate it, transforming it into its active form. Think of it as a superhero costume that needs to be put on before going into action.\nHowever, there’s a challenge: drug resistance. Some viruses can develop a mutation known as H274Y, which makes them resistant to Oseltamivir. This mutation is like a shield that the virus puts up to defend itself.\nBut here’s the good news: the H274Y mutation doesn’t make the virus resistant to Zanamivir. It’s like having two superheroes with different strengths and vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n5.2.5.2 Amantadine and Rimantadine\n\n\n\n\n\nPossible Actions of Amantadine\n\n\n\n\nIn some viruses, like the highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1, there’s an important protein called hemagglutinin (HA). This protein is like the virus’s key to entering host cells. However, for this key to work, it needs to be cut or “cleaved” by certain cellular proteases, like furin.\nNow, here’s where the Golgi apparatus comes into play. Think of it as the virus’s transportation hub. The HA protein is processed and transported through the acidic Golgi apparatus. But there’s a catch—if the cleaved HA undergoes a premature conversion to a fusogenic state, it’s like the key turning too early, and the virus can enter host cells before it’s supposed to.\nEnter the M2 protein. This is another important player in the influenza virus’s game plan. It acts like a pH regulator in the Golgi. It increases the pH in this cellular compartment, kind of like adjusting the acidity level. This increase in pH prevents the premature fusion of the virus’s membrane with the host cell, keeping the virus in check.\nAmantadine, the drug we’re talking about, has an interesting role here. It can also work during these late stages of virus maturation. It’s like a gatekeeper, making sure the M2 protein does its job effectively. By blocking the activity of M2, Amantadine helps maintain the right pH level in the Golgi. This, in turn, prevents the premature fusion of the virus’s membrane, keeping it from entering host cells too soon."

    "section": "5.3 Issues Regarding Antivirals",
    "text": "5.3 Issues Regarding Antivirals\n\n5.3.1 Cost\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAntiviral drugs can be super expensive, and this may be bad news for anybody who needs them, but cannot afford them.\n\n\n5.3.2 Antiviral Drug Resistance\n\n\n\n\n\nIllustration of a Quasispecies\n\n\n\n\nWhen viruses replicate, they don’t always make perfect copies of themselves. It’s like making photocopies of a document with a slightly malfunctioning copier. These imperfect copies lead to a population of related, but not identical, viruses within a single infected individual. This is known as a quasispecies.\nNow, here’s where drug resistance comes into play. Some of these viral variants within the quasispecies might have genetic changes that make them less susceptible to the antiviral drugs we use. It’s like evolution happening at hyper-speed within the virus population. These drug-resistant variants can continue to grow and replicate even when the drug is present, while their drug-sensitive counterparts struggle or die off.\nSo, when we use antiviral drugs, we’re putting pressure on the virus population to evolve. It’s a bit like a selection process. The drugs select for those virus variants that have genetic changes allowing them to survive and replicate in the presence of the drug. Over time, this can lead to the dominance of drug-resistant virus variants.\n\n5.3.2.1 Effect of Speed, Magnitude, and Clinical Impact\nWhen it comes to the development of drug-resistant mutants, the speed, magnitude, and clinical impact can vary significantly. This variation is influenced by several key factors:\n\nMutation Rate: Some viruses naturally have a higher mutation rate than others. For instance, HIV-1 is known for its relatively high mutation rate, leading to a rapid generation of genetic diversity within the virus population.\nReplication Rate: How quickly a virus can replicate within a host also affects the emergence of drug resistance. Faster replication provides more opportunities for genetic mistakes and the evolution of drug-resistant variants.\nVirus Population Size: The size of the virus population in an infected individual matters. More viruses mean a higher chance of some having mutations that confer resistance to drugs.\nVirus Fitness: The fitness of a virus variant, which refers to its ability to replicate and survive in the presence of a drug, is a crucial factor. Drug-resistant variants may have reduced fitness compared to drug-sensitive ones, but this isn’t always the case.\n\nTo illustrate this, let’s consider two examples:\n\n**HIV-1*:** In an HIV-1-infected individual, the virus can generate an astonishing 10 billion virions per day, with approximately one mutation occurring in each generated genome. When drug treatment, such as AZT, is used, it’s often administered for the rest of a person’s life. This extended exposure to the drug creates ample opportunities for drug-resistant mutants to emerge and potentially dominate the viral population.\nHSV (Herpes Simplex Virus): In the case of HSV, the rate of developing resistance to a drug like ACV is relatively low in healthy individuals. This is due to factors such as a smaller virus population, slower virus replication rates, and lower mutation rates. However, in immunocompromised individuals where the virus is not well-controlled by the immune system, ACV resistance can still develop.\n\n\n\n\n5.3.3 Drug Concentration\nAntiviral therapy aims to stop viruses from multiplying inside our bodies. To do that, we use drugs. The goal is to use the right amount of these drugs to completely prevent the virus from making copies of itself. This is important because it helps us get better. However, there’s a problem we need to be careful about. Sometimes, the virus can change and become resistant to the drug. This means the drug doesn’t work anymore.\nThis happens when the drug concentration isn’t just right. If we don’t take the right amount of the drug or if the concentration is too low, it can lead to drug resistance. It’s like not taking your medicine properly. When we don’t use enough of the drug to completely stop the virus, it can start to adapt and become resistant. For example, if someone with the flu takes too little of a drug like Oseltamivir, the flu virus might become resistant to Oseltamivir.\n\n\n5.3.4 Virus Infection Mechanics\n\n\n\n\n\nVirus Infection Mechanics"

    "text": "5.4 Combating Drug Resistance\n\n5.4.1 Screening\n\n\n\n\n\nExample of Screening on the Influenza Virus\n\n\n\n\nSometimes, before giving a patient antiviral drugs, doctors want to make sure the virus won’t resist the treatment. They do this by screening or testing the virus. It’s like checking if a lock is working before you use a key. They use a method called targeted PCR to do this. This test helps find any changes in the virus that might make it resistant to the drug.\nThis screening is important for managing chronic infections, like hepatitis B, HIV, or hepatitis C. These infections can last a long time, and using the right drug is crucial. For example, during a big outbreak of the flu, doctors may check if the virus has a specific change called the H274Y mutation in the NA gene.\n\n\n5.4.2 Drug Combinations\nAnother way to tackle viruses is by using a combination of drugs. It’s like having a team of superheroes fighting the bad guys together. This approach is often called combination therapy. One example is highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), used against HIV.\nWhen we use multiple drugs together, it makes it really hard for the virus to become resistant to all of them. It’s like trying to solve a puzzle with multiple pieces missing. The chances of the virus being resistant to all the drugs at the same time are very low. This combination therapy usually does a great job in stopping the virus from multiplying.\nSometimes, the drugs in the combination work even better when used together. It’s like they team up and become stronger, so we can use lower doses, which are less harmful to the body.\nBut there are challenges too. It can be tricky for patients to manage taking multiple drugs regularly. Also, some drugs can have side effects that might make people feel sick. Plus, not all the drugs needed for combination therapy are always available. So, while it’s a powerful strategy, it’s not without its difficulties.\n\n\n5.4.3 Alternative Strategies\n\n\n\n\n\nPotential Host Cell Factors to Target\n\n\n\n\nScientists look for parts in our body that the virus relies on to multiply and cause trouble. These are called druggable host factors. By finding and blocking these factors, we can stop the virus from doing its thing.\nTo use this strategy, we need to really understand how the virus works, like its life cycle and the steps it takes to infect our cells. This helps us figure out which host factors to target.\nSometimes, we can even use existing drugs for other purposes (drug repurposing) to target these host factors. It’s like using a tool for a different job than it was made for. This can be a quicker and cheaper way to find treatments."

Different tags glow different colors, and this information is useful to help scientists identify what they see.\nThis kind of microscopy can help scientists see parts of viruses in the context of cellular compartments.

    "text": "6.2 Electron Microscopy\n\n\n\n\n\nA Transmission Electron Microscope and a Scanning Electron Microscope\n\n\n\n\nUsing an electron microscope is a complicated deal and one needs expertise to operate and prepare samples. On one hand, electron microscopes can magnify and show a lot of tiny details, but there’s a downside to this: the microscope works in a vacuum - a space without air - so samples need to be dry.\nScientists use these techniques to see things up close using special labels. They attach tiny gold particles to antibodies, and these antibodies can be seen under the microscope and identify specific parts in the samples that they’re looking at.\n\n6.2.1 Scanning Electron Microscopy (i.e., SEM)\n\n\n\n\n\nExamples of Samples Viewed using Scanning Electron Microscopy\n\n\n\n\nScanning electron microscopy (i.e., SEM) is a method used to look at the outside of cells or bigger parts like viruses. Cells are first treated with something called critical point drying to make sure that they’re ready for the microscope.\n\n\n\n\n\nOutline of How SEM Works\n\n\n\n\nThe above figure outlines how SEM typically works:\n\nFixation\nScientist ensure that the cells or samples are fixed. This is almost like taking a picture to ensure that everything stays still.\nDrying\nWater is removed from the samples. Water can mess up the microscope.\nCritical Point Drying\nThis is akin to freeze-drying, but is a technique that helps keep the samples in a good shape for the microscope.\nCoating\nThe sample is coated with a thin layer of a special material - usually metal - to make the samples stronger and ready for the microscope.\nSEM Analysis\nThe sample is put into a SEM - this microscope uses special light to take a super close-up picture of the samples. Scientists can then study these pictures to know more about what it is that they’re looking at.\n\n\n\n6.2.2 Transmission Electron Microscopy (i.e., TEM)\n\n6.2.2.1 Negative Staining\nNegative staining is a way to look at virus particles, their morphology, and detect viruses in clinical material. In this setup, special heavy metals make the virus parts stand out more. Uranyl acetate and phosphotungstic acid are two common choices; these agents don’t color the virus, but they make them easier to see under an electron microscope.\nScientists also use a special grid to look at the viruses under the electron microscope.\n\n\n\n\n\nOutline of How TEM Works\n\n\n\n\nThe above figure outlines how TEM works:\n\nAdding Sample to Buffer\nSamples are added to a special liquid called a buffer - this helps keep sample safe and ready for the following step.\nAdding Heavy Metal Stain\nA special “paint” made out of heavy metals is added to the sample - this helps the microscope see the sample better by giving it strong contrasts (i.e., like dark ink on white paper).\nBlotting\nThe sample is put onto a special surface that soaks up the extra liquid.\nAir Drying\nThe sample is left in the air to dry. This helps the heavy metal paint to stick to the sample and make it ready for viewing.\n\n\n\n6.2.2.2 Immuno-Negative Staining\nWhen negative staining is performed with immunolabelling, this is called immuno-negative staining. First, immunolabelling - putting special “labels” on the objects of interests - is carried out. Then, negative staining is carried out to make the sample easier to look at.\n\n\n6.2.2.3 Thin Sections\nTo study samples closely, scientists need to prepare them carefully:\n\nFirst, they make the cells stay still using a process called fixation.\nThey treat the cells with chemicals and then remove water from them.\nThey put the cells into a special plastic material to keep them in shape. To see virus-infected cells, they need to cut super thin slices, like cutting very thin pieces of cheese. These slices are usually between 80 and 100 nanometers thick.\nThey use a special machine called an ultramicrotome to do this cutting. Once the slices are ready, they put them on a small grid and add some coloring to help see the details better when they use the electron microscope.\n\nSamples can also be immunolabelled before or after embedding (i.e., keeping the cells into a special plastic material) and sectioning."

    "text": "7.1 Cultivating Viruses\nThree people - John Enders, Thomas Weller, and Frederick Robbins - were able to grow poliovirus particles in human cells.\nWhen it comes to growing viruses, scientists use different types of cell systems:\n\nPrimary Cells\nThese are directly taken from tissues and not repeatedly grown in culture. These cells, like chick embryo fibroblasts (CEF), closely resemble the original tissue, but their preparation can be complex and requires tissue access.\nCell Lines\nThese are cells that have been made immortal through processes like transformation, as seen in Vero cells and MDCK cells. While they are easy to maintain, they might lose some characteristics of the original tissue.\nAnimal Tissues or Structures\nThis may involve tissues or structures from animals, such as using suckling mouse brain for flaviviruses or embryonated eggs for influenza.\n\nThe choice of cell system depends on the virus being studied; for example, MDCK cells are preferred for growing influenza viruses.\nTo gather viruses from an infected host, scientists can collect substances like excretions, secretions, blood, or tissue, and then use these materials to infect cell cultures. The virus obtained from this process is known as a virus isolate.\nSometimes, viruses change to grow better in specific cell lines, leading to genetic modifications associated with adapting to cell cultures. This can be problematic for researchers wanting to study the virus in its natural form (undesirable), but it’s also useful for developing weakened virus vaccines (desirable) since it forms the foundation for making attenuated viral vaccines.\n\n7.1.1 Cytopathic Effect\n\n\n\n\n\nExample of the Cytopathic Effect\n\n\n\n\nWhen viruses infect cultured cells, they can cause different visual changes in the cells’ appearance. These changes are collectively called cytopathic effect or “CPE”. The specific type of CPE can vary depending on the virus and the type of cell it infects.\n\n\n7.1.2 Particle / PFU Ratio\nThe particle or pfu ratio is a comparison between the total number of virus particles and the number of infectious particles, usually measured in plaque forming units (i.e., pfu). In an ideal scenario, this ratio would be 1.0, indicating that all particles are infectious.\nHowever, in real-world situations, this ratio is typically greater than 1.0. For instance, with influenza, this ratio can be around 10, suggesting that not all virus particles are capable of causing infection.\n\n\n7.1.3 Multiplicity of Infection (i.e., MOI)\nThe Multiplicity of Infection (i.e., moi) measures the average amount of infectious virus introduced to each cell. For instance, an moi of 1 means adding 1 pfu per cell. It’s important to determine this for a specific virus stock preparation.\nTo create a virus stock, a low moi is used, usually ranging from 0.01 to 0.1. This helps prevent the creation of defective interfering particles, which would increase the particle/pfu ratio.\nOn the other hand, studies focusing on virus replication use a higher moi, typically between 5 and 10, ensuring that all cells are infected simultaneously. To calculate moi accurately, it’s necessary to know both the cell count and the number of infectious particles being added."

    "text": "7.2 Quantifying Viruses\nThere are two main types of assays used to study viruses:\n\nInfectivity assays\nThese tests are designed to measure the presence of infectious virus particles. They determine whether the virus is capable of infecting and replicating within host cells.\nNon-infectivity assays\nThese assays are used to measure the quantity of virus present in a sample, regardless of whether the virus is still capable of causing infection. They provide information about the overall amount of viral material in the sample.\n\n\n7.2.1 Virus Infectivity Assays\n\n7.2.1.1 Plaque Assay\n\n\n\n\n\nResults from a Plaque Assay\n\n\n\n\nThe plaque assay is a technique that exploits the fact that a single infectious virus particle can cause a visible area of damage, like cell death. Here’s how it works:\n\nScientists create serial dilutions of a virus suspension and apply these dilutions to a layer of cells. The cells are then incubated for a specific period, which varies depending on the virus.\nAn overlay is added to the cell layer to restrict the spread of the virus, allowing local virus replication to occur.\nAfter some time, the cells are stained so that the areas of damage, called plaques, become visible to the naked eye.\nEach plaque originates from a single infectious virus particle. This helps researchers count the number of infectious particles in the initial virus suspension.\nDifferent types of cells are used for different viruses. For example, MDCK cells are used for influenza, and HEp2 cells are used for RSV. This is because different viruses interact better with specific cell types.\n\nIn essence, the plaque assay is a method for quantifying the number of infectious virus particles in a sample and allows researchers to study their effects on cells.\nThe plaque assay method can be adapted in various ways to suit specific needs:\n\nDifferent overlay medium\nInstead of using the standard overlay, various substances like agarose, carboxymethyl cellulose (cmc), or avecel can be used. These substances modify how the virus spreads and affects cells.\nDifferent visualization methods for plaques\nPlaques, the visible areas of cell damage, can be detected in diverse ways. This could involve visual observation (noting cell death) or using immunostaining techniques to identify specific viral proteins or markers associated with infected cells. These variations allow researchers to tailor the assay to their objectives and the characteristics of the virus being studied.\n\n\n\n7.2.1.2 Endpoint Assay\nThe endpoint assay is employed when certain viruses don’t create plaques or foci but instead lead to noticeable cytopathic effects (CPE), such as the measles virus on Vero cells.\nHere’s how the endpoint assay works:\n\nReplicates and TCID50\nMultiple repetitions of the assay are conducted using different virus dilutions. The dilution at which 50% of these replicates show CPE is determined. This provides a value known as the TCID50 (50% Tissue Culture Infectious Dose).\nReed and Muench calculation\nTo calculate TCID50, the Reed and Muench method is commonly employed. This involves statistical calculations to estimate the viral concentration based on the observed outcomes in the replicates.\n\nThe endpoint assay is an alternate method for quantifying viral infectivity when plaque formation isn’t applicable. It helps researchers gauge the virus’s impact on cell cultures.\n\n\n\n7.2.2 Other Assays\n\n7.2.2.1 Haemagglutination Assay\n\n\n\n\n\nSchematic of a Haemagglutination Assay\n\n\n\n\nBack in 1941, George Hirst made a significant breakthrough by showing that the influenza virus could clump together red blood cells.\nThis discovery introduced the first quick and quantitative technique for measuring viruses that affect eukaryotic cells. For the first time, it became possible to actually count viruses. This method, which measures the level of influenza virus, is still in use today.\n\n\n7.2.2.2 Direct Particle Count\n\n\n\n\n\nIllustration of a Direct Particle Count\n\n\n\n\nThe direct particle count method involves estimating the quantity of virus particles using electron microscopy. Here’s how it works:\n\nUsing visible markers\nScientists incorporate a known concentration of easily visible markers, like latex beads, into the virus sample.\nElectron microscopy\nThe sample is then examined under an electron microscope, allowing researchers to observe and count both the virus particles and the added markers.\n\nHowever, it’s important to note that this method doesn’t differentiate between infectious and noninfectious virus particles. While it provides a measure of the total number of particles, it doesn’t offer insights into their infectivity."

    "text": "8.1 Reverse Genetics\nSometimes, scientists want to understand how certain changes in viruses can affect their behavior. It’s like studying what happens when you change some parts of a toy.\nTo do this, they aim to create a sort of “genetic blueprint” for the virus, a bit like having a recipe that can make the virus. This blueprint is made of DNA and allows them to generate a virus that can actually infect cells and do its thing.\nFor viruses with positive-strand RNA, it’s quite direct. It’s like having a simple recipe that’s easy to follow.\nHowever, for viruses with negative-strand RNA or other complex types, things get tricky. It’s like having a tricky recipe that’s not easy to understand. Scientists need to figure out ways to work with these viruses, and sometimes it’s quite complicated. In fact, for some viruses, there aren’t even good methods yet.\n\n8.1.1 Genetic Recombination from Cloned DNA\n\n8.1.1.1 Positive Stranded Viruses\n\n\n\n\n\nOverview of Replication Strategy of Positive Stranded Viruses\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8.1.1.2 Negative Stranded Viruses\n\n\n\n\n\nOverview of Replication Strategy of Negative Stranded Viruses\n\n\n\n\nSome examples of generating negative stranded RNA viruses via reverse genetics include:\n\nParamyxovirus\nTo get the virus working, it’s like having a team of players. The main players are L (polymerase), P (cofactor), and N (vRNA binder), and they need to work together to do their job.\nTo make this happen, scientists put together a special setup. It’s like gathering the right players for a game. They put bits of genetic instructions for L, P, and N into the cell, just like sending in players to play their roles (i.e., plasmids containing L, P, and N). They also add in the virus’s complete instructions.\nImagine it’s like getting the team’s players and the playbook ready to start the game.\nInfluenza Virus\n\n\n\n\n\nAppearance of a Flu Virus\n\n\n\n\nImagine the Influenza virus as a set of building blocks, but instead of having all the instructions on one block, they spread them out on different blocks. It’s like having different pages of a recipe in separate books.\nIn the case of the Influenza A virus, it’s like having 8 different books, each with its own set of instructions for making different parts of the virus.\nTo build the virus, certain blocks have special jobs. Think of these blocks as the leaders of the construction team. There are four blocks named NP, PB1, PB2, and PA. These four work together like a powerful team to make the virus’s “building crew,” kind of like a mastermind group.\n\n\n\n\n8.1.2 12 Plasmid System\n\n\n\n\n\n12 Plasmid System\n\n\n\n\nWhen scientists want to make a virus do something, it’s like giving it a job to perform. They use special “worker molecules” called RNA pol1 or pol2, kind of like having different teams for different tasks.\nNow, here comes an interesting point. Imagine the virus’s instructions are like puzzle pieces. For some viruses with many pieces (segments), scientists need more instruction cards (plasmids) to complete the puzzle. Think of it like needing more recipe cards to make a big meal.\nCurrently, for some viruses, scientists need around 12 or 8 of these special cards (i.e., plasmids) to make the virus work properly. It’s like needing a lot of recipe cards to make a complex dish.\n\n\n8.1.3 Applications\nUsually, flu vaccines are made using eggs. It’s like using eggs as tiny factories to create the vaccine.\nBut there’s a challenge. The H5N1 virus is a bit tricky. It’s really strong and can cause problems in the labs where it’s grown, which is like a high-security zone. Because it’s so strong, it even harms the eggs used to grow it, like breaking the eggs you want to use for cooking.\nBecause of this, the amount of virus that can be grown is limited. It’s like not having enough ingredients to make a big batch of food.\n\n\n\n\n\n12 Plasmid System to Generate H5N1 Virus Particles\n\n\n\n\nWhen there’s a tricky virus like H5N1 that’s causing problems, scientists use reverse genetics. It’s like solving a puzzle backwards.\nThey create a new virus that’s safe and not very risky. This new virus can also grow well in eggs, like the ones they use for making vaccines."

It helps us understand how contagious a disease is.\nImagine there’s a new disease, and nobody has been exposed to it before. The R number tells us how many new cases we can expect from just one infected person.\nHere’s the deal: If the R number is 2, it means that one sick person is likely to pass the disease to two other people. And then those two people can each pass it to two more, and so on. The R number helps us see how fast a disease can spread.\nBut, this number assumes that no one is already immune to the disease and that nobody has been vaccinated. In the real world, things are a bit more complicated, but the R number gives us a starting point to understand how easily a disease can jump from person to person."

    "text": "9.2 Modes of Virus Transmission\n\n\n\n\n\nSeveral Modes of Transmission of Viruses\n\n\n\n\nThe above figure shows how viruses can spread from one human (i.e., host) to another - for instance, through the air, the fecal-oral (i.e., from contaminated poop), and vice versa.\n\n9.2.1 Respiratory Route\n\n\n\n\n\nExample of Respiratory Transmission\n\n\n\n\nYou know when someone sneezes, and you see those little water droplets in the air? Those are like tiny vehicles for germs. If you’re close to someone who’s sick and they sneeze, those droplets might carry the flu virus, and if you breathe them in, you can get sick too.\nIn 2018, there were a lot of people around the world who got sick with the flu, and sadly, many of them passed away. The World Health Organization reported up to 646,000 deaths from the flu.\n\n\n9.2.2 Fomites\n\n\n\n\n\nExamples of Fomites\n\n\n\n\nFomites are just things like surfaces and objects. Sometimes, when people are sick, they can leave tiny drops of their respiratory secretions (like from coughing or sneezing) on these surfaces.\nIf a person touches these contaminated surfaces, they can pick up those germs on their hands. And if they touch their face, like their mouth or nose, those germs can get inside their body, making them sick too.\nA couple of diseases, like SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) and RSV (Respiratory Syncytial Virus), can spread this way. It’s not as far-reaching as aerosols (those tiny droplets in the air), so it usually affects people who are in closer contact with each other or who touch the same things.\n\n\n9.2.3 Blood\n\n\n\n\n\nDisease Transmission Through Blood\n\n\n\n\nTwo examples are HBV (Hepatitis B) and HCV (Hepatitis C). These diseases can be spread through blood in a few different ways.\nOne way is through blood transfusion. Sometimes, people need to receive blood from donors, like during surgeries or if they have certain medical conditions. If the blood they receive is infected with HBV or HCV, it can make them sick.\nAnother way is through contaminated blood products. Sometimes, people with specific medical conditions need treatments that use blood products. If these products aren’t screened and tested for diseases like HBV and HCV, they can end up causing infections.\n\n\n9.2.4 Fecal Oral Route\nThere are different ways through which some viruses can make people sick, and we can break these down into a few categories. One way is by eating contaminated food. For example, hepatitis A can be found in shellfish. If these shellfish are not properly cleaned or cooked, the virus can get into our bodies when we eat them.\nAnother way is by ingesting contaminated water. This means drinking water that’s been polluted, often with sewage. The polio virus is one example of a virus that can spread through contaminated water.\nViruses can also spread through direct contact with infected people or by touching things they’ve touched. For instance, when we shake hands with someone who has a virus, we might pick it up. This can also happen when we touch things that are contaminated with viruses, like doorknobs or surfaces. The Norwalk virus is one that can spread this way.\nAnd when it comes to the “CRAP” viruses, it’s an easy way to remember four groups of viruses that can make us sick: C for Calicivirus (like Norwalk), R for Rotavirus, A for Adenovirus, and P for Picornavirus (which includes viruses like Hepatitis A and Poliovirus).\nFinally, using shared needles for things like drug use can also spread these diseases. When people share needles, there’s a risk that they can accidentally inject themselves with blood from someone else who’s infected.\n\n\n\n\n\nStatistics Pertaining to the Rotavirus\n\n\n\n\nThe thing about Enteroviruses is that they cause about 215000 deaths in children per year (which is about 3.14% of all child deaths across the globe).\n\n\n9.2.5 Veneral\nThis just refers to sex (i.e., unprotected sex). Interestingly enough, there’s evidence to suggest that although the Zika virus is generally spread through mosquitos, that it can also spread via sex."

    "section": "9.3 Modes of Transmission",
    "text": "9.3 Modes of Transmission\nZoonosis is a term used to describe how viruses can be passed from animals to humans. This can happen in several ways and involve many different animals. Sometimes, the transmission occurs directly from animals to humans, like when we’re in close contact with them. Other times, it’s indirect, and we might get the virus through something that came from animals, like their meat or other products.\nWhen it comes to zoonotic viruses, they often have a close connection to specific animals. This means that a particular virus is usually passed from a certain animal to humans. In some cases, insects play a role in this transmission. For instance, the Aedes mosquito can carry viruses like dengue and yellow fever. Ticks are another example and can transmit viruses like Tick-borne encephalitis. Even tiny creatures like Culicoides, often called midges, can be involved in spreading viruses such as the Blue tongue virus. Sand flies are culprits too, transmitting viruses like Chandipura.\nIt’s not just insects; other animals also play a role. Wild animals, like dogs, can transmit the rabies virus. Even animals we’re more familiar with, like chickens, can be carriers of zoonotic viruses. Chickens, for instance, can carry the avian H5N1 influenza virus. So, zoonotic viruses have various paths to reach humans, and specific animals are often part of this transmission process.\n\n9.3.1 Arboviruses\nSome viruses are quite crafty and employ insects as their messengers, spreading infections. These are called Arboviruses, and a couple of examples include dengue and yellow fever viruses. Here’s how it works: these viruses make themselves at home inside insects. After an insect feeds on an infected host (like a human or animal), the virus multiplies inside the insect. Then, when the insect bites another host (like another human), it transfers the virus along with its saliva.\nThe virus gets into the new host’s body at the bite site and starts multiplying there. After a bit of replication at the bite site, it moves into the bloodstream and travels around the body. It can infect various organs and tissues, depending on the virus. For instance, yellow fever virus often sets up shop in the liver tissue. So, these arboviruses have a pretty complex journey, involving both insects and humans or animals to spread their infections.\n\n\n\n\n\nUrban and Jungle Cycle of the Yellow Fever Virus\n\n\n\n\nThe Yellow Fever Virus (i.e., YFV) also spreads two ways: the urban and the jungle cycle.\n\n\n9.3.2 Indirect versus Direct Transmission\n\n\n\n\n\nExamples of Indirect and Direct Transmission\n\n\n\n\nVirus transmission can happen through direct or indirect means. In direct transmission, the virus goes directly from one host to another, like when a person gets infected from handling infected chickens with avian H5N1 virus.\nIndirect transmission is a bit more complicated. It might involve an intermediate species, which acts as a middleman for the virus. For instance, a virus could go from a bat to a primate, and then from that primate to a human. So, in this case, it takes a little detour through an intermediate host before reaching the final destination, which is the human"

    "section": "9.4 Route of Entry and Tissue Tropism",
    "text": "9.4 Route of Entry and Tissue Tropism\nWhen a virus enters a host, the initial cells it infects depend on how it enters the body. This is like the virus’s first point of contact with the host.\nAfter the virus enters the body, there’s a waiting period called the incubation period. During this time, the virus multiplies, creating more of itself. This is an important step for the virus to establish an infection. It’s like the virus needs to build an army before it can start causing trouble.\n\n\n\n\n\nVirus Amounts Over Time\n\n\n\n\nThe virus might move from where it initially entered to a specific organ or tissue in the body. It’s like the virus is traveling to its favorite vacation spot inside the host. It can use different methods to do this, like hitching a ride through the bloodstream (which is called viremia) or even traveling through the nervous system.\nAll these movements and replications take time, and this whole process leads to the onset of disease symptoms. How soon these symptoms show up depends on which organ or tissue the virus has infected. When the symptoms appear, it’s usually when the immune system is working at its maximum level, trying to fight off the virus.\n\n9.4.1 Acute versus Chronic Infections\nWhen you have an acute infection, it means you get sick, but it doesn’t last very long. The symptoms come and go relatively quickly, and your body manages to clear the virus. Sometimes you recover completely, like when you catch a common cold (rhinovirus). But in more severe cases, it can lead to death, as seen with the highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAI H5N1).\nOn the other hand, chronic infection means the symptoms and the virus stick around in your body for a long time. You don’t get better quickly. Some examples are hepatitis B and HIV-1. In these cases, the virus can stay with you for years, and it’s harder for your body to get rid of it. It’s like having a persistent guest that doesn’t want to leave.\nWhether someone recovers from an infection or doesn’t make it (death) affects how the virus can spread to others.\nIf someone gets better, it’s less likely they’ll pass the virus to someone else. They might not be contagious anymore.\nBut if the person doesn’t make it (dies), the virus could still infect others. It depends on the virus and how it spreads."

    "text": "9.5 Quarantines\n\n\n\n\n\nExamples of Diseases that Warrant a Quarantine\n\n\n\n\nQuarantine is a powerful method to stop the spread of infections. It’s like keeping infected individuals away from healthy people.\nWhere you quarantine someone depends on how the virus behaves:\n\nSometimes, people can stay at home, and it’s called self-home quarantine. This works well for illnesses like seasonal flu.\nBut for really dangerous or new viruses with high death rates, like SARS, special facilities are used. These places are designed to keep the virus from getting out and infecting more people.\n\nIn both cases, the goal is to prevent the virus from going to new people and slow down the disease’s spread.\nFinding infected people, especially when we’re dealing with a new virus and might not have many tests, can be really tricky, especially at places like airports. Imagine trying to test everyone; it’s just not practical.\n\n\n\n\n\nExample of a Heatmap in an Airport Setting\n\n\n\n\nOne way to tackle this problem is by using a strategy that’s a bit like a heat map. Instead of testing everyone, we can look at a lot of information, like who’s traveling from places where the virus is common, and who’s showing signs of illness. Then we can focus our testing efforts on those who seem more likely to be infected.\nThis way, we’re trying to be smart about where we look for infections and not waste resources testing everyone.\n\n9.5.1 Drugs and Quarantine\nImagine you have a new vaccine to protect people from a disease, but you can’t give it to everyone. So what do you do? You use a strategy called ring vaccination. Here’s how it works.\nFirst, you find someone who’s sick with the disease, let’s say it’s a new virus. You then trace back to see who this sick person has been in close contact with – family, friends, people they work with, and so on.\n\n\n\n\n\nIllustration of Ring Immunity\n\n\n\n\nThen, you vaccinate those close contacts. This way, if any of them were already infected but didn’t show symptoms yet, the vaccine can help stop them from spreading the virus to others.\nBut, sometimes it’s hard to trace all those contacts, especially if the virus is spreading quickly. In that case, instead of tracing contacts, you might decide to just vaccinate everyone in the area where the disease is spreading. This way, you’re covering a larger group to stop the virus in its tracks.\nSo, ring vaccination is like creating a protective ring around the disease, trying to keep it from spreading any further. It’s a smart way to use vaccines to stop outbreaks.\n\n\n9.5.2 Antivirus Drugs\nSo, what if we don’t have a vaccine for a disease, like during a fast-spreading flu pandemic? In this case, we can turn to antiviral drugs. These are special medications that can help slow down how quickly the virus spreads.\nImagine there’s a new flu virus that’s making a lot of people sick, and we don’t have a vaccine for it yet. But we do have antiviral drugs like Tamiflu. We can use these drugs to reduce how many people get infected.\nOne way to use them is by giving the antiviral drugs to people who are most likely to catch the virus. For example, healthcare workers who are in close contact with sick patients.\nHowever, there’s a catch. Viruses can sometimes change and become resistant to these drugs. It’s a bit like how some bacteria can become resistant to antibiotics. So, while antiviral drugs can help in a pandemic, we need to be careful about not overusing them.\n\n\n9.5.3 Swiss Cheese Model\n\n\n\n\n\nIllustration of the Swiss Cheese Model\n\n\n\n\nThink of controlling a virus like protecting a piece of cheese. There’s no single method that can block the virus completely. So, we use a bunch of different measures, like slices of Swiss cheese, to protect ourselves.\nEach slice represents a different way to stop the virus from spreading. Some slices might be personal things like wearing masks, washing your hands, and staying home when you’re sick. Other slices are shared, like testing and tracing to find out who’s infected and quarantine to keep them isolated.\nThe idea is that when you stack all these slices together, it becomes really hard for the virus to slip through the holes in the cheese. So, even if one layer has some gaps, the other layers help block the virus."

However, it’s worth nothing that these sequences really depend on the genome and also how the virus assembles in the first place.\n\n4.1.1 Nucleocapsid Proteins\nAll viruses have something called a nucleocapsid protein - what this does is basically keeps the virus’ genome in a sort of spiral conformation that is maintained by a small number of the nucleocapsid’s subunits and the genome’s packaging signals (i.e., its proteins). This spiral can elongate with more nucleocapid subunits.\n\n\n\n\n\nNucleocpasid Protein Formation in a HIV Virus\n\n\n\n\nIf we look at the HIV virus, a protein called psi has a sort of stem loop structure that binds to two zinc binding domains in the virus’ nucleocapsid protein. These domains are super flexible when they’re not bound to anything; only when they are ordered do they become more ordered.\n\n\n\n\n\nGenome Insertion in a Large Virus\n\n\n\n\nIn the case of large viruses like the one above (i.e., epsilon15), the genetic material can be inserted into a preformed protein shell (i.e., like filling up a cream puff).\n\n\n\n\n\nAssembly in a Reovirus\n\n\n\n\nAlternatively, if we look at double stranded DNA in a reovirus, we see that the 5’ end of the mRNA has to pass through a “portal” of a core particle.

    "section": "4.2 Assembling the Virus",
    "text": "4.2 Assembling the Virus\nThis can happen in one of two ways depending on whether the virus in question is enveloped or not.\n\n4.2.1 Non-Enveloped Viruses\nThese viruses assemble in the cytoplasm or in the nucleus. The capsid - the protein shell of the virus - helps protect the virus from being degraded by the environment. Though, in some cases, the virus particles are released in a way that causes the cells to burst in a process called lysis - the poliovirus does this.\n\n4.2.1.1 Example: Adenovirus in the Nucleus\n\n\n\n\n\nAssembly of an Adenovirus\n\n\n\n\nAfter the virus uses the host cell’s ribosomes to perform protein synthesis, the proteins need to go back into the nucleus.\nAmong one of many proteins that need to go back to the nucleus is called CA - this depends on another protein called the polypeptide VI protein (i.e., pVI). pVI contains a nuclear localization signal (i.e., NLS) - this is like a passport that allows the protein to gain entry into the cell.\nInside the nucleus, the virus’ capsid forms and the virus’ DNA is put into them. These capsids then get treated by proteases to go from young to mature.\nThe viruses cause the cell to undergo lysis.\n\n\n\n4.2.2 Enveloped Viruses\nThese viruses must get a lipid bilayer (i.e., a layer of fatty acids) when they assemble, and this process can happen anywhere depending on where the virus first assembled.\nThis lipid bilayer also protects the virus from being degraded by the environment.\n\n4.2.2.1 Example: HSV in the Nucleus\n\n\n\n\n\nAssembly of a HSV\n\n\n\n\nThere are four main steps:\n\nThe virus’ capsid forms in the nucleus in a very complicated way.\nThis capsid then goes through the nuclear membrane - this requires two things: a phosphoprotein and a transmembrane protein\nThis capsid is first engulfed by the inner nuclear membrane before it leaves through the outer nuclear membrane.\nThis capsid then gets uptaken by the Golgi membrane.\n\n\n\n\n4.2.3 How Does the Flu Virus Assemble?\n\n\n\n\n\nAssembly of the Influenza Virus\n\n\n\n\nThe influenza virus is different from other RNA viruses as its ribonucleoproteins (i.e., RNPs) need to go from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. This moving is aided by the M and NEP proteins.\nHowever, only the NEP proteins have a nuclear export signal (i.e., NES) that allows it to leave the nucleus. This NES overcomes the NLS that the NP and P proteins have.\nThis NES then goes on to bind to another protein called exportin 1 (i.e., CRM1) - this helps the RNP go into the cytoplasm.\n\n\n4.2.4 Virus Assembly at the Membranes\n\n\n\n\n\nVirus Assembly at the Cellular Membranes\n\n\n\n\nWhen viruses assemble on the cell’s membranes, something known as endosomal sorting complexes (i.e., ESCRT) are needed. These ESCRT complexes help shape the cell’s membrane in a way that allows it to bud away from the cytoplasm.\n\n\n\n\n\nDifferent Membrane Budding Sites\n\n\n\n\nThe above figure shows various locations that a virus can bud from:\n\nThrough the plasma membrane - viruses like the RSV or the influenza virus do this. Secretory vesicles that contain the virus can also be made.\nThrough the internal membranes, like the ER (e.g., the rotavirus), the Golgi apparatus (e.g., the Hataan virus), or the nuclear membranes (e.g., the HSV-1 virus).\n\nIf the virus leaves from the internal membranes, then mature viruses can only be released. In many cases, the glycoproteins that the virus has can influence where budding happens.\n\n\n4.2.5 Modifications of Viral Proteins\nThere are a few ways that viral proteins can be modified - especially during budding:\n\nGlycosylation\n\n\n\n\n\nDifferent Glycosylation Outcomes\n\n\n\n\nWhen glycosylation doesn’t happen, this can interfere with the activity of some viral fusion protein - like the RSV’s F protein. Though, glycosylation can also affect how proteases cleave the influenza virus’ HA protein.\nAttaching Lipids to Viral Proteins\n\n\n\n\n\nAttachment of Palmitoyl Groups to Cysteine Residues\n\n\n\n\nWhen something called palmitoyl is attached to the amino acid cysteine, scientist think that this may help stabilize viral fusion proteins. This typically happens on the carbon terminus of the cysteine residue - this happens on the cytoplasm side of the protein.\nMyristylation - on the other hand - refers to adding something called myristic acid to the nitrogen end of glycine.\nProteolytic Cleavage\nThe reality is that many viral fusion proteins need to be activated by proteases (i.e., proteins that promote degradtion) so that they can perform their functions.\n\n\n\n\n\nEbola Virus’ G Protein Being Cleaved by Furin\n\n\n\n\nA protease called furin and proteases similar to furin can be found in the Golgi apparatus. Furin is found in many cell types and has multiple cleavage sites.\nThere are also cell-specific proteases like the Clara protease. These proteases are typically specific to tissues and only work on single to double amino acids."

There’s something called the raft hypothesis that states that certain areas (i.e., microdomains) of the cell membrane have more types of a specific kind of lipid.\n\n4.3.2.1 Why do Lipid Rafts Form?\nDifferent kinds of lipids in the membranes of an animal’s cell don’t all provide the same stability.\nThat said, virus assembly can occur in these lipid raft microdomains. Many kinds of viruses - including the HIV and influenza virus - tend to use lipid rafts as a way of releasing themselves."
